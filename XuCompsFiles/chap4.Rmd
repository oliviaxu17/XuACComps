# marktwainr {#rmd-basics}

### About
To easily replicate the analysis performed in this project, I have compiled an R package called `marktwainr` so that anybody can easily use and play with the selected works of Mark Twain.  To install this package, follow the code below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("oliviaxu17/marktwainr")
library(marktwainr)
```
