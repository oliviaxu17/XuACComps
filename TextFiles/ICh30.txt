"3"	"“See Naples and die.”  Well, I do not know that one would necessarily die"
"4"	"after merely seeing it, but to attempt to live there might turn out a"
"5"	"little differently.  To see Naples as we saw it in the early dawn from"
"6"	"far up on the side of Vesuvius, is to see a picture of wonderful beauty."
"7"	"At that distance its dingy buildings looked white--and so, rank on rank"
"8"	"of balconies, windows and roofs, they piled themselves up from the blue"
"9"	"ocean till the colossal castle of St. Elmo topped the grand white pyramid"
"10"	"and gave the picture symmetry, emphasis and completeness.  And when its"
"11"	"lilies turned to roses--when it blushed under the sun’s first kiss--it"
"12"	"was beautiful beyond all description.  One might well say, then, “See"
"13"	"Naples and die.”  The frame of the picture was charming, itself.  In"
"14"	"front, the smooth sea--a vast mosaic of many colors; the lofty islands"
"15"	"swimming in a dreamy haze in the distance; at our end of the city the"
"16"	"stately double peak of Vesuvius, and its strong black ribs and seams of"
"17"	"lava stretching down to the limitless level campagna--a green carpet that"
"18"	"enchants the eye and leads it on and on, past clusters of trees, and"
"19"	"isolated houses, and snowy villages, until it shreds out in a fringe of"
"20"	"mist and general vagueness far away.  It is from the Hermitage, there on"
"21"	"the side of Vesuvius, that one should “see Naples and die.”"
"22"	"But do not go within the walls and look at it in detail.  That takes away"
"23"	"some of the romance of the thing.  The people are filthy in their habits,"
"24"	"and this makes filthy streets and breeds disagreeable sights and smells."
"25"	"There never was a community so prejudiced against the cholera as these"
"26"	"Neapolitans are.  But they have good reason to be.  The cholera generally"
"27"	"vanquishes a Neapolitan when it seizes him, because, you understand,"
"28"	"before the doctor can dig through the dirt and get at the disease the man"
"29"	"dies.  The upper classes take a sea-bath every day, and are pretty"
"30"	"decent."
"31"	"The streets are generally about wide enough for one wagon, and how they"
"32"	"do swarm with people!  It is Broadway repeated in every street, in every"
"33"	"court, in every alley!  Such masses, such throngs, such multitudes of"
"34"	"hurrying, bustling, struggling humanity!  We never saw the like of it,"
"35"	"hardly even in New York, I think.  There are seldom any sidewalks, and"
"36"	"when there are, they are not often wide enough to pass a man on without"
"37"	"caroming on him.  So everybody walks in the street--and where the street"
"38"	"is wide enough, carriages are forever dashing along.  Why a thousand"
"39"	"people are not run over and crippled every day is a mystery that no man"
"40"	"can solve.  But if there is an eighth wonder in the world, it must be the"
"41"	"dwelling-houses of Naples.  I honestly believe a good majority of them"
"42"	"are a hundred feet high!  And the solid brick walls are seven feet"
"43"	"through.  You go up nine flights of stairs before you get to the “first”"
"44"	" floor.  No, not nine, but there or thereabouts.  There is a little"
"45"	"bird-cage of an iron railing in front of every window clear away up, up,"
"46"	"up, among the eternal clouds, where the roof is, and there is always"
"47"	"somebody looking out of every window--people of ordinary size looking"
"48"	"out from the first floor, people a shade smaller from the second, people"
"49"	"that look a little smaller yet from the third--and from thence upward"
"50"	"they grow smaller and smaller by a regularly graduated diminution, till"
"51"	"the folks in the topmost windows seem more like birds in an uncommonly"
"52"	"tall martin-box than any thing else.  The perspective of one of these"
"53"	"narrow cracks of streets, with its rows of tall houses stretching away"
"54"	"till they come together in the distance like railway tracks; its"
"55"	"clothes-lines crossing over at all altitudes and waving their bannered"
"56"	"raggedness over the swarms of people below; and the white-dressed women"
"57"	"perched in balcony railings all the way from the pavement up to the"
"58"	"heavens--a perspective like that is really worth going into Neapolitan"
"59"	"details to see."
"60"	"                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED."
"61"	"Naples, with its immediate suburbs, contains six hundred and twenty-five"
"62"	"thousand inhabitants, but I am satisfied it covers no more ground than an"
"63"	"American city of one hundred and fifty thousand.  It reaches up into the"
"64"	"air infinitely higher than three American cities, though, and there is"
"65"	"where the secret of it lies.  I will observe here, in passing, that the"
"66"	"contrasts between opulence and poverty, and magnificence and misery, are"
"67"	"more frequent and more striking in Naples than in Paris even.  One must"
"68"	"go to the Bois de Boulogne to see fashionable dressing, splendid"
"69"	"equipages and stunning liveries, and to the Faubourg St. Antoine to see"
"70"	"vice, misery, hunger, rags, dirt--but in the thoroughfares of Naples"
"71"	"these things are all mixed together.  Naked boys of nine years and the"
"72"	"fancy-dressed children of luxury; shreds and tatters, and brilliant"
"73"	"uniforms; jackass-carts and state-carriages; beggars, Princes and"
"74"	"Bishops, jostle each other in every street.  At six o’clock every"
"75"	"evening, all Naples turns out to drive on the ‘Riviere di Chiaja’,"
"76"	"(whatever that may mean;) and for two hours one may stand there and see"
"77"	"the motliest and the worst mixed procession go by that ever eyes beheld."
"78"	"Princes (there are more Princes than policemen in Naples--the city is"
"79"	"infested with them)--Princes who live up seven flights of stairs and"
"80"	"don’t own any principalities, will keep a carriage and go hungry; and"
"81"	"clerks, mechanics, milliners and strumpets will go without their dinners"
"82"	"and squander the money on a hack-ride in the Chiaja; the rag-tag and"
"83"	"rubbish of the city stack themselves up, to the number of twenty or"
"84"	"thirty, on a rickety little go-cart hauled by a donkey not much bigger"
"85"	"than a cat, and they drive in the Chiaja; Dukes and bankers, in sumptuous"
"86"	"carriages and with gorgeous drivers and footmen, turn out, also, and so"
"87"	"the furious procession goes.  For two hours rank and wealth, and"
"88"	"obscurity and poverty clatter along side by side in the wild procession,"
"89"	"and then go home serene, happy, covered with glory!"
"90"	"I was looking at a magnificent marble staircase in the King’s palace, the"
"91"	"other day, which, it was said, cost five million francs, and I suppose it"
"92"	"did cost half a million, may be.  I felt as if it must be a fine thing to"
"93"	"live in a country where there was such comfort and such luxury as this."
"94"	"And then I stepped out musing, and almost walked over a vagabond who was"
"95"	"eating his dinner on the curbstone--a piece of bread and a bunch of"
"96"	"grapes.  When I found that this mustang was clerking in a fruit"
"97"	"establishment (he had the establishment along with him in a basket,) at"
"98"	"two cents a day, and that he had no palace at home where he lived, I lost"
"99"	"some of my enthusiasm concerning the happiness of living in Italy."
"100"	"This naturally suggests to me a thought about wages here.  Lieutenants in"
"101"	"the army get about a dollar a day, and common soldiers a couple of cents."
"102"	"I only know one clerk--he gets four dollars a month.  Printers get six"
"103"	"dollars and a half a month, but I have heard of a foreman who gets"
"104"	"thirteen."
"105"	"To be growing suddenly and violently rich, as this man is, naturally"
"106"	"makes him a bloated aristocrat.  The airs he puts on are insufferable."
"107"	"And, speaking of wages, reminds me of prices of merchandise.  In Paris"
"108"	"you pay twelve dollars a dozen for Jouvin’s best kid gloves; gloves of"
"109"	"about as good quality sell here at three or four dollars a dozen.  You"
"110"	"pay five and six dollars apiece for fine linen shirts in Paris; here and"
"111"	"in Leghorn you pay two and a half.  In Marseilles you pay forty dollars"
"112"	"for a first-class dress coat made by a good tailor, but in Leghorn you"
"113"	"can get a full dress suit for the same money.  Here you get handsome"
"114"	"business suits at from ten to twenty dollars, and in Leghorn you can get"
"115"	"an overcoat for fifteen dollars that would cost you seventy in New York."
"116"	"Fine kid boots are worth eight dollars in Marseilles and four dollars"
"117"	"here.  Lyons velvets rank higher in America than those of Genoa.  Yet the"
"118"	"bulk of Lyons velvets you buy in the States are made in Genoa and"
"119"	"imported into Lyons, where they receive the Lyons stamp and are then"
"120"	"exported to America.  You can buy enough velvet in Genoa for twenty-five"
"121"	"dollars to make a five hundred dollar cloak in New York--so the ladies"
"122"	"tell me.  Of course these things bring me back, by a natural and easy"
"123"	"transition, to the"
"124"	"                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED."
"125"	"And thus the wonderful Blue Grotto is suggested to me.  It is situated on"
"126"	"the Island of Capri, twenty-two miles from Naples.  We chartered a little"
"127"	"steamer and went out there.  Of course, the police boarded us and put us"
"128"	"through a health examination, and inquired into our politics, before they"
"129"	"would let us land.  The airs these little insect Governments put on are"
"130"	"in the last degree ridiculous.  They even put a policeman on board of our"
"131"	"boat to keep an eye on us as long as we were in the Capri dominions."
"132"	"They thought we wanted to steal the grotto, I suppose.  It was worth"
"133"	"stealing.  The entrance to the cave is four feet high and four feet wide,"
"134"	"and is in the face of a lofty perpendicular cliff--the sea-wall.  You"
"135"	"enter in small boats--and a tight squeeze it is, too.  You can not go in"
"136"	"at all when the tide is up.  Once within, you find yourself in an arched"
"137"	"cavern about one hundred and sixty feet long, one hundred and twenty"
"138"	"wide, and about seventy high.  How deep it is no man knows.  It goes down"
"139"	"to the bottom of the ocean.  The waters of this placid subterranean lake"
"140"	"are the brightest, loveliest blue that can be imagined.  They are as"
"141"	"transparent as plate glass, and their coloring would shame the richest"
"142"	"sky that ever bent over Italy.  No tint could be more ravishing, no"
"143"	"lustre more superb.  Throw a stone into the water, and the myriad of tiny"
"144"	"bubbles that are created flash out a brilliant glare like blue theatrical"
"145"	"fires.  Dip an oar, and its blade turns to splendid frosted silver,"
"146"	"tinted with blue.  Let a man jump in, and instantly he is cased in an"
"147"	"armor more gorgeous than ever kingly Crusader wore."
"148"	"Then we went to Ischia, but I had already been to that island and tired"
"149"	"myself to death “resting” a couple of days and studying human villainy,"
"150"	"with the landlord of the Grande Sentinelle for a model.  So we went to"
"151"	"Procida, and from thence to Pozzuoli, where St. Paul landed after he"
"152"	"sailed from Samos.  I landed at precisely the same spot where St. Paul"
"153"	"landed, and so did Dan and the others.  It was a remarkable coincidence."
"154"	"St. Paul preached to these people seven days before he started to Rome."
"155"	"Nero’s Baths, the ruins of Baiae, the Temple of Serapis; Cumae, where the"
"156"	"Cumaen Sybil interpreted the oracles, the Lake Agnano, with its ancient"
"157"	"submerged city still visible far down in its depths--these and a hundred"
"158"	"other points of interest we examined with critical imbecility, but the"
"159"	"Grotto of the Dog claimed our chief attention, because we had heard and"
"160"	"read so much about it.  Every body has written about the Grotto del Cane"
"161"	"and its poisonous vapors, from Pliny down to Smith, and every tourist has"
"162"	"held a dog over its floor by the legs to test the capabilities of the"
"163"	"place.  The dog dies in a minute and a half--a chicken instantly.  As a"
"164"	"general thing, strangers who crawl in there to sleep do not get up until"
"165"	"they are called.  And then they don’t either.  The stranger that ventures"
"166"	"to sleep there takes a permanent contract.  I longed to see this grotto."
"167"	"I resolved to take a dog and hold him myself; suffocate him a little, and"
"168"	"time him; suffocate him some more and then finish him.  We reached the"
"169"	"grotto at about three in the afternoon, and proceeded at once to make the"
"170"	"experiments.  But now, an important difficulty presented itself.  We had"
"171"	"no dog."
"172"	"                     ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED."
"173"	"At the Hermitage we were about fifteen or eighteen hundred feet above the"
"174"	"sea, and thus far a portion of the ascent had been pretty abrupt.  For"
"175"	"the next two miles the road was a mixture--sometimes the ascent was"
"176"	"abrupt and sometimes it was not: but one characteristic it possessed all"
"177"	"the time, without failure--without modification--it was all"
"178"	"uncompromisingly and unspeakably infamous.  It was a rough, narrow trail,"
"179"	"and led over an old lava flow--a black ocean which was tumbled into a"
"180"	"thousand fantastic shapes--a wild chaos of ruin, desolation, and"
"181"	"barrenness--a wilderness of billowy upheavals, of furious whirlpools, of"
"182"	"miniature mountains rent asunder--of gnarled and knotted, wrinkled and"
"183"	"twisted masses of blackness that mimicked branching roots, great vines,"
"184"	"trunks of trees, all interlaced and mingled together: and all these weird"
"185"	"shapes, all this turbulent panorama, all this stormy, far-stretching"
"186"	"waste of blackness, with its thrilling suggestiveness of life, of action,"
"187"	"of boiling, surging, furious motion, was petrified!--all stricken dead"
"188"	"and cold in the instant of its maddest rioting!--fettered, paralyzed, and"
"189"	"left to glower at heaven in impotent rage for evermore!"
"190"	"Finally we stood in a level, narrow valley (a valley that had been"
"191"	"created by the terrific march of some old time irruption) and on either"
"192"	"hand towered the two steep peaks of Vesuvius.  The one we had to climb"
"193"	"--the one that contains the active volcano--seemed about eight hundred or"
"194"	"one thousand feet high, and looked almost too straight-up-and-down for"
"195"	"any man to climb, and certainly no mule could climb it with a man on his"
"196"	"back.  Four of these native pirates will carry you to the top in a sedan"
"197"	"chair, if you wish it, but suppose they were to slip and let you fall,"
"198"	"--is it likely that you would ever stop rolling?  Not this side of"
"199"	"eternity, perhaps.  We left the mules, sharpened our finger-nails, and"
"200"	"began the ascent I have been writing about so long, at twenty minutes to"
"201"	"six in the morning.  The path led straight up a rugged sweep of loose"
"202"	"chunks of pumice-stone, and for about every two steps forward we took, we"
"203"	"slid back one.  It was so excessively steep that we had to stop, every"
"204"	"fifty or sixty steps, and rest a moment.  To see our comrades, we had to"
"205"	"look very nearly straight up at those above us, and very nearly straight"
"206"	"down at those below.  We stood on the summit at last--it had taken an"
"207"	"hour and fifteen minutes to make the trip."
"208"	"What we saw there was simply a circular crater--a circular ditch, if you"
"209"	"please--about two hundred feet deep, and four or five hundred feet wide,"
"210"	"whose inner wall was about half a mile in circumference.  In the centre"
"211"	"of the great circus ring thus formed, was a torn and ragged upheaval a"
"212"	"hundred feet high, all snowed over with a sulphur crust of many and many"
"213"	"a brilliant and beautiful color, and the ditch inclosed this like the"
"214"	"moat of a castle, or surrounded it as a little river does a little"
"215"	"island, if the simile is better.  The sulphur coating of that island was"
"216"	"gaudy in the extreme--all mingled together in the richest confusion were"
"217"	"red, blue, brown, black, yellow, white--I do not know that there was a"
"218"	"color, or shade of a color, or combination of colors, unrepresented--and"
"219"	"when the sun burst through the morning mists and fired this tinted"
"220"	"magnificence, it topped imperial Vesuvius like a jeweled crown!"
"221"	"The crater itself--the ditch--was not so variegated in coloring, but yet,"
"222"	"in its softness, richness, and unpretentious elegance, it was more"
"223"	"charming, more fascinating to the eye.  There was nothing “loud” about"
"224"	"its well-bred and well-creased look.  Beautiful?  One could stand and"
"225"	"look down upon it for a week without getting tired of it.  It had the"
"226"	"semblance of a pleasant meadow, whose slender grasses and whose velvety"
"227"	"mosses were frosted with a shining dust, and tinted with palest green"
"228"	"that deepened gradually to the darkest hue of the orange leaf, and"
"229"	"deepened yet again into gravest brown, then faded into orange, then into"
"230"	"brightest gold, and culminated in the delicate pink of a new-blown rose."
"231"	"Where portions of the meadow had sunk, and where other portions had been"
"232"	"broken up like an ice-floe, the cavernous openings of the one, and the"
"233"	"ragged upturned edges exposed by the other, were hung with a lace-work of"
"234"	"soft-tinted crystals of sulphur that changed their deformities into"
"235"	"quaint shapes and figures that were full of grace and beauty."
"236"	"The walls of the ditch were brilliant with yellow banks of sulphur and"
"237"	"with lava and pumice-stone of many colors.  No fire was visible any"
"238"	"where, but gusts of sulphurous steam issued silently and invisibly from a"
"239"	"thousand little cracks and fissures in the crater, and were wafted to our"
"240"	"noses with every breeze.  But so long as we kept our nostrils buried in"
"241"	"our handkerchiefs, there was small danger of suffocation."
"242"	"Some of the boys thrust long slips of paper down into holes and set them"
"243"	"on fire, and so achieved the glory of lighting their cigars by the flames"
"244"	"of Vesuvius, and others cooked eggs over fissures in the rocks and were"
"245"	"happy."
"246"	"The view from the summit would have been superb but for the fact that the"
"247"	"sun could only pierce the mists at long intervals.  Thus the glimpses we"
"248"	"had of the grand panorama below were only fitful and unsatisfactory."
"249"	"                               THE DESCENT."
"250"	"The descent of the mountain was a labor of only four minutes.  Instead of"
"251"	"stalking down the rugged path we ascended, we chose one which was bedded"
"252"	"knee-deep in loose ashes, and ploughed our way with prodigious strides"
"253"	"that would almost have shamed the performance of him of the seven-league"
"254"	"boots."
"255"	"The Vesuvius of today is a very poor affair compared to the mighty"
"256"	"volcano of Kilauea, in the Sandwich Islands, but I am glad I visited it."
"257"	"It was well worth it."
"258"	"It is said that during one of the grand eruptions of Vesuvius it"
"259"	"discharged massy rocks weighing many tons a thousand feet into the air,"
"260"	"its vast jets of smoke and steam ascended thirty miles toward the"
"261"	"firmament, and clouds of its ashes were wafted abroad and fell upon the"
"262"	"decks of ships seven hundred and fifty miles at sea!  I will take the"
"263"	"ashes at a moderate discount, if any one will take the thirty miles of"
"264"	"smoke, but I do not feel able to take a commanding interest in the whole"
"265"	"story by myself."
"266"	"CHAPTER XXXI."
