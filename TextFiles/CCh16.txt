"2"	"MORGAN LE FAY"
"3"	"If knights errant were to be believed, not all castles were desirable"
"4"	"places to seek hospitality in.  As a matter of fact, knights errant"
"5"	"were _not_ persons to be believed--that is, measured by modern"
"6"	"standards of veracity; yet, measured by the standards of their own"
"7"	"time, and scaled accordingly, you got the truth.  It was very"
"8"	"simple: you discounted a statement ninety-seven per cent; the rest"
"9"	"was fact.  Now after making this allowance, the truth remained"
"10"	"that if I could find out something about a castle before ringing"
"11"	"the door-bell--I mean hailing the warders--it was the sensible"
"12"	"thing to do.  So I was pleased when I saw in the distance a horseman"
"13"	"making the bottom turn of the road that wound down from this castle."
"14"	"As we approached each other, I saw that he wore a plumed helmet,"
"15"	"and seemed to be otherwise clothed in steel, but bore a curious"
"16"	"addition also--a stiff square garment like a herald’s tabard."
"17"	"However, I had to smile at my own forgetfulness when I got nearer"
"18"	"and read this sign on his tabard:"
"19"	"  “Persimmon’s Soap -- All the Prime-Donna Use It.”"
"20"	"That was a little idea of my own, and had several wholesome purposes"
"21"	"in view toward the civilizing and uplifting of this nation.  In the"
"22"	"first place, it was a furtive, underhand blow at this nonsense"
"23"	"of knight errantry, though nobody suspected that but me.  I had"
"24"	"started a number of these people out--the bravest knights I could"
"25"	"get--each sandwiched between bulletin-boards bearing one device"
"26"	"or another, and I judged that by and by when they got to be numerous"
"27"	"enough they would begin to look ridiculous; and then, even the"
"28"	"steel-clad ass that _hadn’t_ any board would himself begin to look"
"29"	"ridiculous because he was out of the fashion."
"30"	"Secondly, these missionaries would gradually, and without creating"
"31"	"suspicion or exciting alarm, introduce a rudimentary cleanliness"
"32"	"among the nobility, and from them it would work down to the people,"
"33"	"if the priests could be kept quiet.  This would undermine the Church."
"34"	"I mean would be a step toward that.  Next, education--next, freedom"
"35"	"--and then she would begin to crumble.  It being my conviction that"
"36"	"any Established Church is an established crime, an established"
"37"	"slave-pen, I had no scruples, but was willing to assail it in"
"38"	"any way or with any weapon that promised to hurt it.  Why, in my"
"39"	"own former day--in remote centuries not yet stirring in the womb"
"40"	"of time--there were old Englishmen who imagined that they had been"
"41"	"born in a free country: a “free” country with the Corporation Act"
"42"	"and the Test still in force in it--timbers propped against men’s"
"43"	"liberties and dishonored consciences to shore up an Established"
"44"	"Anachronism with."
"45"	"My missionaries were taught to spell out the gilt signs on their"
"46"	"tabards--the showy gilding was a neat idea, I could have got the"
"47"	"king to wear a bulletin-board for the sake of that barbaric"
"48"	"splendor--they were to spell out these signs and then explain to"
"49"	"the lords and ladies what soap was; and if the lords and ladies"
"50"	"were afraid of it, get them to try it on a dog.  The missionary’s"
"51"	"next move was to get the family together and try it on himself;"
"52"	"he was to stop at no experiment, however desperate, that could"
"53"	"convince the nobility that soap was harmless; if any final doubt"
"54"	"remained, he must catch a hermit--the woods were full of them;"
"55"	"saints they called themselves, and saints they were believed to be."
"56"	"They were unspeakably holy, and worked miracles, and everybody"
"57"	"stood in awe of them.  If a hermit could survive a wash, and that"
"58"	"failed to convince a duke, give him up, let him alone."
"59"	"Whenever my missionaries overcame a knight errant on the road"
"60"	"they washed him, and when he got well they swore him to go and"
"61"	"get a bulletin-board and disseminate soap and civilization the rest"
"62"	"of his days.  As a consequence the workers in the field were"
"63"	"increasing by degrees, and the reform was steadily spreading."
"64"	"My soap factory felt the strain early.  At first I had only two"
"65"	"hands; but before I had left home I was already employing fifteen,"
"66"	"and running night and day; and the atmospheric result was getting"
"67"	"so pronounced that the king went sort of fainting and gasping"
"68"	"around and said he did not believe he could stand it much longer,"
"69"	"and Sir Launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but walk up"
"70"	"and down the roof and swear, although I told him it was worse up"
"71"	"there than anywhere else, but he said he wanted plenty of air; and"
"72"	"he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap"
"73"	"factory anyway, and said if a man was to start one in his house"
"74"	"he would be damned if he wouldn’t strangle him.  There were ladies"
"75"	"present, too, but much these people ever cared for that; they would"
"76"	"swear before children, if the wind was their way when the factory"
"77"	"was going."
"78"	"This missionary knight’s name was La Cote Male Taile, and he said"
"79"	"that this castle was the abode of Morgan le Fay, sister of"
"80"	"King Arthur, and wife of King Uriens, monarch of a realm about"
"81"	"as big as the District of Columbia--you could stand in the middle"
"82"	"of it and throw bricks into the next kingdom.  “Kings” and “Kingdoms”"
"83"	" were as thick in Britain as they had been in little Palestine in"
"84"	"Joshua’s time, when people had to sleep with their knees pulled up"
"85"	"because they couldn’t stretch out without a passport."
"86"	"La Cote was much depressed, for he had scored here the worst"
"87"	"failure of his campaign.  He had not worked off a cake; yet he had"
"88"	"tried all the tricks of the trade, even to the washing of a hermit;"
"89"	"but the hermit died.  This was, indeed, a bad failure, for this"
"90"	"animal would now be dubbed a martyr, and would take his place"
"91"	"among the saints of the Roman calendar.  Thus made he his moan,"
"92"	"this poor Sir La Cote Male Taile, and sorrowed passing sore.  And"
"93"	"so my heart bled for him, and I was moved to comfort and stay him."
"94"	"Wherefore I said:"
"95"	"“Forbear to grieve, fair knight, for this is not a defeat.  We have"
"96"	"brains, you and I; and for such as have brains there are no defeats,"
"97"	"but only victories.  Observe how we will turn this seeming disaster"
"98"	"into an advertisement; an advertisement for our soap; and the"
"99"	"biggest one, to draw, that was ever thought of; an advertisement"
"100"	"that will transform that Mount Washington defeat into a Matterhorn"
"101"	"victory.  We will put on your bulletin-board, ‘_Patronized by the"
"102"	"elect_.’  How does that strike you?”"
"103"	"“Verily, it is wonderly bethought!”"
"104"	"“Well, a body is bound to admit that for just a modest little"
"105"	"one-line ad, it’s a corker.”"
"106"	"So the poor colporteur’s griefs vanished away.  He was a brave"
"107"	"fellow, and had done mighty feats of arms in his time.  His chief"
"108"	"celebrity rested upon the events of an excursion like this one"
"109"	"of mine, which he had once made with a damsel named Maledisant,"
"110"	"who was as handy with her tongue as was Sandy, though in a different"
"111"	"way, for her tongue churned forth only railings and insult, whereas"
"112"	"Sandy’s music was of a kindlier sort.  I knew his story well, and so"
"113"	"I knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he"
"114"	"bade me farewell.  He supposed I was having a bitter hard time of it."
"115"	"Sandy and I discussed his story, as we rode along, and she said"
"116"	"that La Cote’s bad luck had begun with the very beginning of that"
"117"	"trip; for the king’s fool had overthrown him on the first day,"
"118"	"and in such cases it was customary for the girl to desert to the"
"119"	"conqueror, but Maledisant didn’t do it; and also persisted afterward"
"120"	"in sticking to him, after all his defeats.  But, said I, suppose"
"121"	"the victor should decline to accept his spoil?  She said that that"
"122"	"wouldn’t answer--he must.  He couldn’t decline; it wouldn’t be"
"123"	"regular.  I made a note of that.  If Sandy’s music got to be too"
"124"	"burdensome, some time, I would let a knight defeat me, on the chance"
"125"	"that she would desert to him."
"126"	"In due time we were challenged by the warders, from the castle"
"127"	"walls, and after a parley admitted.  I have nothing pleasant to"
"128"	"tell about that visit.  But it was not a disappointment, for I knew"
"129"	"Mrs. le Fay by reputation, and was not expecting anything pleasant."
"130"	"She was held in awe by the whole realm, for she had made everybody"
"131"	"believe she was a great sorceress.  All her ways were wicked, all"
"132"	"her instincts devilish.  She was loaded to the eyelids with cold"
"133"	"malice.  All her history was black with crime; and among her crimes"
"134"	"murder was common.  I was most curious to see her; as curious as"
"135"	"I could have been to see Satan.  To my surprise she was beautiful;"
"136"	"black thoughts had failed to make her expression repulsive, age"
"137"	"had failed to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its bloomy freshness."
"138"	"She could have passed for old Uriens’ granddaughter, she could"
"139"	"have been mistaken for sister to her own son."
"140"	"As soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered"
"141"	"into her presence.  King Uriens was there, a kind-faced old man"
"142"	"with a subdued look; and also the son, Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains,"
"143"	"in whom I was, of course, interested on account of the tradition"
"144"	"that he had once done battle with thirty knights, and also on"
"145"	"account of his trip with Sir Gawaine and Sir Marhaus, which Sandy"
"146"	"had been aging me with.  But Morgan was the main attraction, the"
"147"	"conspicuous personality here; she was head chief of this household,"
"148"	"that was plain.  She caused us to be seated, and then she began,"
"149"	"with all manner of pretty graces and graciousnesses, to ask me"
"150"	"questions.  Dear me, it was like a bird or a flute, or something,"
"151"	"talking.  I felt persuaded that this woman must have been"
"152"	"misrepresented, lied about.  She trilled along, and trilled along,"
"153"	"and presently a handsome young page, clothed like the rainbow, and"
"154"	"as easy and undulatory of movement as a wave, came with something"
"155"	"on a golden salver, and, kneeling to present it to her, overdid"
"156"	"his graces and lost his balance, and so fell lightly against her"
"157"	"knee.  She slipped a dirk into him in as matter-of-course a way as"
"158"	"another person would have harpooned a rat!"
"159"	"Poor child! he slumped to the floor, twisted his silken limbs in"
"160"	"one great straining contortion of pain, and was dead.  Out of the"
"161"	"old king was wrung an involuntary “O-h!” of compassion.  The look"
"162"	"he got, made him cut it suddenly short and not put any more hyphens"
"163"	"in it.  Sir Uwaine, at a sign from his mother, went to the anteroom"
"164"	"and called some servants, and meanwhile madame went rippling sweetly"
"165"	"along with her talk."
"166"	"I saw that she was a good housekeeper, for while she talked she"
"167"	"kept a corner of her eye on the servants to see that they made"
"168"	"no balks in handling the body and getting it out; when they came"
"169"	"with fresh clean towels, she sent back for the other kind; and"
"170"	"when they had finished wiping the floor and were going, she indicated"
"171"	"a crimson fleck the size of a tear which their duller eyes had"
"172"	"overlooked.  It was plain to me that La Cote Male Taile had failed"
"173"	"to see the mistress of the house.  Often, how louder and clearer"
"174"	"than any tongue, does dumb circumstantial evidence speak."
"175"	"Morgan le Fay rippled along as musically as ever.  Marvelous woman."
"176"	"And what a glance she had: when it fell in reproof upon those"
"177"	"servants, they shrunk and quailed as timid people do when the"
"178"	"lightning flashes out of a cloud.  I could have got the habit"
"179"	"myself.  It was the same with that poor old Brer Uriens; he was"
"180"	"always on the ragged edge of apprehension; she could not even turn"
"181"	"toward him but he winced."
"182"	"In the midst of the talk I let drop a complimentary word about"
"183"	"King Arthur, forgetting for the moment how this woman hated her"
"184"	"brother.  That one little compliment was enough.  She clouded up"
"185"	"like storm; she called for her guards, and said:"
"186"	"“Hale me these varlets to the dungeons.”"
"187"	"That struck cold on my ears, for her dungeons had a reputation."
"188"	"Nothing occurred to me to say--or do.  But not so with Sandy."
"189"	"As the guard laid a hand upon me, she piped up with the tranquilest"
"190"	"confidence, and said:"
"191"	"“God’s wounds, dost thou covet destruction, thou maniac?  It is"
"192"	"The Boss!”"
"193"	"Now what a happy idea that was!--and so simple; yet it would never"
"194"	"have occurred to me.  I was born modest; not all over, but in spots;"
"195"	"and this was one of the spots."
"196"	"The effect upon madame was electrical.  It cleared her countenance"
"197"	"and brought back her smiles and all her persuasive graces and"
"198"	"blandishments; but nevertheless she was not able to entirely cover up"
"199"	"with them the fact that she was in a ghastly fright. She said:"
"200"	"“La, but do list to thine handmaid! as if one gifted with powers"
"201"	"like to mine might say the thing which I have said unto one who"
"202"	"has vanquished Merlin, and not be jesting.  By mine enchantments"
"203"	"I foresaw your coming, and by them I knew you when you entered"
"204"	"here.  I did but play this little jest with hope to surprise you"
"205"	"into some display of your art, as not doubting you would blast"
"206"	"the guards with occult fires, consuming them to ashes on the spot,"
"207"	"a marvel much beyond mine own ability, yet one which I have long"
"208"	"been childishly curious to see.”"
"209"	"The guards were less curious, and got out as soon as they got permission."
