"1"	"CHAPTER LVI."
"2"	"We rumbled over the plains and valleys, climbed the Sierras to the"
"3"	"clouds, and looked down upon summer-clad California.  And I will remark"
"4"	"here, in passing, that all scenery in California requires distance to"
"5"	"give it its highest charm.  The mountains are imposing in their sublimity"
"6"	"and their majesty of form and altitude, from any point of view--but one"
"7"	"must have distance to soften their ruggedness and enrich their tintings;"
"8"	"a Californian forest is best at a little distance, for there is a sad"
"9"	"poverty of variety in species, the trees being chiefly of one monotonous"
"10"	"family--redwood, pine, spruce, fir--and so, at a near view there is a"
"11"	"wearisome sameness of attitude in their rigid arms, stretched down ward"
"12"	"and outward in one continued and reiterated appeal to all men to “Sh!"
"13"	"--don’t say a word!--you might disturb somebody!”  Close at hand, too,"
"14"	"there is a reliefless and relentless smell of pitch and turpentine; there"
"15"	"is a ceaseless melancholy in their sighing and complaining foliage; one"
"16"	"walks over a soundless carpet of beaten yellow bark and dead spines of"
"17"	"the foliage till he feels like a wandering spirit bereft of a footfall;"
"18"	"he tires of the endless tufts of needles and yearns for substantial,"
"19"	"shapely leaves; he looks for moss and grass to loll upon, and finds none,"
"20"	"for where there is no bark there is naked clay and dirt, enemies to"
"21"	"pensive musing and clean apparel.  Often a grassy plain in California, is"
"22"	"what it should be, but often, too, it is best contemplated at a distance,"
"23"	"because although its grass blades are tall, they stand up vindictively"
"24"	"straight and self-sufficient, and are unsociably wide apart, with"
"25"	"uncomely spots of barren sand between."
"26"	"One of the queerest things I know of, is to hear tourists from “the"
"27"	"States” go into ecstasies over the loveliness of “ever-blooming"
"28"	"California.”  And they always do go into that sort of ecstasies.  But"
"29"	"perhaps they would modify them if they knew how old Californians, with"
"30"	"the memory full upon them of the dust-covered and questionable summer"
"31"	"greens of Californian “verdure,” stand astonished, and filled with"
"32"	"worshipping admiration, in the presence of the lavish richness, the"
"33"	"brilliant green, the infinite freshness, the spend-thrift variety of form"
"34"	"and species and foliage that make an Eastern landscape a vision of"
"35"	"Paradise itself.  The idea of a man falling into raptures over grave and"
"36"	"sombre California, when that man has seen New England’s meadow-expanses"
"37"	"and her maples, oaks and cathedral-windowed elms decked in summer attire,"
"38"	"or the opaline splendors of autumn descending upon her forests, comes"
"39"	"very near being funny--would be, in fact, but that it is so pathetic."
"40"	"No land with an unvarying climate can be very beautiful.  The tropics are"
"41"	"not, for all the sentiment that is wasted on them.  They seem beautiful"
"42"	"at first, but sameness impairs the charm by and by.  Change is the"
"43"	"handmaiden Nature requires to do her miracles with.  The land that has"
"44"	"four well-defined seasons, cannot lack beauty, or pall with monotony."
"45"	"Each season brings a world of enjoyment and interest in the watching of"
"46"	"its unfolding, its gradual, harmonious development, its culminating"
"47"	"graces--and just as one begins to tire of it, it passes away and a"
"48"	"radical change comes, with new witcheries and new glories in its train."
"49"	"And I think that to one in sympathy with nature, each season, in its"
"50"	"turn, seems the loveliest."
"51"	"San Francisco, a truly fascinating city to live in, is stately and"
"52"	"handsome at a fair distance, but close at hand one notes that the"
"53"	"architecture is mostly old-fashioned, many streets are made up of"
"54"	"decaying, smoke-grimed, wooden houses, and the barren sand-hills toward"
"55"	"the outskirts obtrude themselves too prominently.  Even the kindly"
"56"	"climate is sometimes pleasanter when read about than personally"
"57"	"experienced, for a lovely, cloudless sky wears out its welcome by and by,"
"58"	"and then when the longed for rain does come it stays.  Even the playful"
"59"	"earthquake is better contemplated at a dis----"
"60"	"However there are varying opinions about that."
"61"	"The climate of San Francisco is mild and singularly equable.  The"
"62"	"thermometer stands at about seventy degrees the year round.  It hardly"
"63"	"changes at all.  You sleep under one or two light blankets Summer and"
"64"	"Winter, and never use a mosquito bar.  Nobody ever wears Summer clothing."
"65"	"You wear black broadcloth--if you have it--in August and January, just"
"66"	"the same.  It is no colder, and no warmer, in the one month than the"
"67"	"other.  You do not use overcoats and you do not use fans.  It is as"
"68"	"pleasant a climate as could well be contrived, take it all around, and is"
"69"	"doubtless the most unvarying in the whole world.  The wind blows there a"
"70"	"good deal in the summer months, but then you can go over to Oakland, if"
"71"	"you choose--three or four miles away--it does not blow there.  It has"
"72"	"only snowed twice in San Francisco in nineteen years, and then it only"
"73"	"remained on the ground long enough to astonish the children, and set them"
"74"	"to wondering what the feathery stuff was."
"75"	"During eight months of the year, straight along, the skies are bright and"
"76"	"cloudless, and never a drop of rain falls.  But when the other four"
"77"	"months come along, you will need to go and steal an umbrella.  Because"
"78"	"you will require it.  Not just one day, but one hundred and twenty days"
"79"	"in hardly varying succession.  When you want to go visiting, or attend"
"80"	"church, or the theatre, you never look up at the clouds to see whether it"
"81"	"is likely to rain or not--you look at the almanac.  If it is Winter, it"
"82"	"will rain--and if it is Summer, it won’t rain, and you cannot help it."
"83"	"You never need a lightning-rod, because it never thunders and it never"
"84"	"lightens.  And after you have listened for six or eight weeks, every"
"85"	"night, to the dismal monotony of those quiet rains, you will wish in your"
"86"	"heart the thunder would leap and crash and roar along those drowsy skies"
"87"	"once, and make everything alive--you will wish the prisoned lightnings"
"88"	"would cleave the dull firmament asunder and light it with a blinding"
"89"	"glare for one little instant.  You would give anything to hear the old"
"90"	"familiar thunder again and see the lightning strike somebody.  And along"
"91"	"in the Summer, when you have suffered about four months of lustrous,"
"92"	"pitiless sunshine, you are ready to go down on your knees and plead for"
"93"	"rain--hail--snow--thunder and lightning--anything to break the monotony"
"94"	"--you will take an earthquake, if you cannot do any better.  And the"
"95"	"chances are that you’ll get it, too."
"96"	"San Francisco is built on sand hills, but they are prolific sand hills."
"97"	"They yield a generous vegetation.  All the rare flowers which people in"
"98"	"“the States” rear with such patient care in parlor flower-pots and"
"99"	"green-houses, flourish luxuriantly in the open air there all the year"
"100"	"round. Calla lilies, all sorts of geraniums, passion flowers, moss"
"101"	"roses--I do not know the names of a tenth part of them.  I only know that"
"102"	"while New Yorkers are burdened with banks and drifts of snow,"
"103"	"Californians are burdened with banks and drifts of flowers, if they only"
"104"	"keep their hands off and let them grow.  And I have heard that they have"
"105"	"also that rarest and most curious of all the flowers, the beautiful"
"106"	"Espiritu Santo, as the Spaniards call it--or flower of the Holy Spirit"
"107"	"--though I thought it grew only in Central America--down on the Isthmus."
"108"	"In its cup is the daintiest little facsimile of a dove, as pure as snow."
"109"	"The Spaniards have a superstitious reverence for it.  The blossom has"
"110"	"been conveyed to the States, submerged in ether; and the bulb has been"
"111"	"taken thither also, but every attempt to make it bloom after it arrived,"
"112"	"has failed."
"113"	"I have elsewhere spoken of the endless Winter of Mono, California, and"
"114"	"but this moment of the eternal Spring of San Francisco.  Now if we travel"
"115"	"a hundred miles in a straight line, we come to the eternal Summer of"
"116"	"Sacramento.  One never sees Summer-clothing or mosquitoes in San"
"117"	"Francisco--but they can be found in Sacramento.  Not always and"
"118"	"unvaryingly, but about one hundred and forty-three months out of twelve"
"119"	"years, perhaps.  Flowers bloom there, always, the reader can easily"
"120"	"believe--people suffer and sweat, and swear, morning, noon and night, and"
"121"	"wear out their stanchest energies fanning themselves.  It gets hot there,"
"122"	"but if you go down to Fort Yuma you will find it hotter.  Fort Yuma is"
"123"	"probably the hottest place on earth.  The thermometer stays at one"
"124"	"hundred and twenty in the shade there all the time--except when it varies"
"125"	"and goes higher.  It is a U.S. military post, and its occupants get so"
"126"	"used to the terrific heat that they suffer without it.  There is a"
"127"	"tradition (attributed to John Phenix [It has been purloined by fifty"
"128"	"different scribblers who were too poor to invent a fancy but not ashamed"
"129"	"to steal one.--M.  T.]) that a very, very wicked soldier died there,"
"130"	"once, and of course, went straight to the hottest corner of perdition,"
"131"	"--and the next day he telegraphed back for his blankets.  There is no doubt"
"132"	"about the truth of this statement--there can be no doubt about it.  I"
"133"	"have seen the place where that soldier used to board.  In Sacramento it"
"134"	"is fiery Summer always, and you can gather roses, and eat strawberries"
"135"	"and ice-cream, and wear white linen clothes, and pant and perspire, at"
"136"	"eight or nine o’clock in the morning, and then take the cars, and at noon"
"137"	"put on your furs and your skates, and go skimming over frozen Donner"
"138"	"Lake, seven thousand feet above the valley, among snow banks fifteen feet"
"139"	"deep, and in the shadow of grand mountain peaks that lift their frosty"
"140"	"crags ten thousand feet above the level of the sea."
"141"	"There is a transition for you!  Where will you find another like it in"
"142"	"the Western hemisphere?  And some of us have swept around snow-walled"
"143"	"curves of the Pacific Railroad in that vicinity, six thousand feet above"
"144"	"the sea, and looked down as the birds do, upon the deathless Summer of"
"145"	"the Sacramento Valley, with its fruitful fields, its feathery foliage,"
"146"	"its silver streams, all slumbering in the mellow haze of its enchanted"
"147"	"atmosphere, and all infinitely softened and spiritualized by distance--a"
"148"	"dreamy, exquisite glimpse of fairyland, made all the more charming and"
"149"	"striking that it was caught through a forbidden gateway of ice and snow,"
"150"	"and savage crags and precipices."
