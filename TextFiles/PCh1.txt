"2"	"Pudd'nhead Wins His Name."
"3"	"Tell the truth or trump--but get the trick.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's"
"4"	"Calendar."
"5"	"The scene of this chronicle is the town of Dawson's Landing, on the"
"6"	"Missouri side of the Mississippi, half a day's journey, per steamboat,"
"7"	"below St. Louis."
"8"	"In 1830 it was a snug little collection of modest one- and two-story"
"9"	"frame dwellings whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from"
"10"	"sight by climbing tangles of rose-vines, honeysuckles, and"
"11"	"morning-glories. Each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced"
"12"	"with white palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks, marigolds,"
"13"	"touch-me-nots, prince's-feathers and other old-fashioned flowers; while"
"14"	"on the window-sills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing"
"15"	"moss-rose plants and terra-cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium"
"16"	"whose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint"
"17"	"of the rose-clad house-front like an explosion of flame. When there was"
"18"	"room on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat, the cat was"
"19"	"there--in sunny weather--stretched at full length, asleep and blissful,"
"20"	"with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose. Then"
"21"	"that house was complete, and its contentment and peace were made"
"22"	"manifest to the world by this symbol, whose testimony is infallible. A"
"23"	"home without a cat--and a well-fed, well-petted and properly revered"
"24"	"cat--may be a perfect home, perhaps, but how can it prove title?"
"25"	"All along the streets, on both sides, at the outer edge of the brick"
"26"	"sidewalks, stood locust-trees with trunks protected by wooden boxing,"
"27"	"and these furnished shade for summer and a sweet fragrance in spring"
"28"	"when the clusters of buds came forth. The main street, one block back"
"29"	"from the river, and running parallel with it, was the sole business"
"30"	"street. It was six blocks long, and in each block two or three brick"
"31"	"stores three stories high towered above interjected bunches of little"
"32"	"frame shops. Swinging signs creaked in the wind, the street's whole"
"33"	"length. The candy-striped pole which indicates nobility proud and"
"34"	"ancient along the palace-bordered canals of Venice, indicated merely the"
"35"	"humble barber shop along the main street of Dawson's Landing. On a chief"
"36"	"corner stood a lofty unpainted pole wreathed from top to bottom with tin"
"37"	"pots and pans and cups, the chief tinmonger's noisy notice to the world"
"38"	"(when the wind blew) that his shop was on hand for business at that"
"39"	"corner."
"40"	"The hamlet's front was washed by the clear waters of the great river;"
"41"	"its body stretched itself rearward up a gentle incline; its most"
"42"	"rearward border fringed itself out and scattered its houses about the"
"43"	"base-line of the hills; the hills rose high, inclosing the town in a"
"44"	"half-moon curve, clothed with forests from foot to summit."
"45"	"Steamboats passed up and down every hour or so. Those belonging to the"
"46"	"little Cairo line and the little Memphis line always stopped; the big"
"47"	"Orleans liners stopped for hails only, or to land passengers or freight;"
"48"	"and this was the case also with the great flotilla of \"transients.\""
"49"	"These latter came out of a dozen rivers--the Illinois, the Missouri, the"
"50"	"Upper Mississippi, the Ohio, the Monongahela, the Tennessee, the Red"
"51"	"River, the White River, and so on; and were bound every whither and"
"52"	"stocked with every imaginable comfort or necessity which the"
"53"	"Mississippi's communities could want, from the frosty Falls of St."
"54"	"Anthony down through nine climates to torrid New Orleans."
"55"	"Dawson's Landing was a slaveholding town, with a rich slave-worked grain"
"56"	"and pork country back of it. The town was sleepy and comfortable and"
"57"	"contented. It was fifty years old, and was growing slowly--very slowly,"
"58"	"in fact, but still it was growing."
"59"	"The chief citizen was York Leicester Driscoll, about forty years old,"
"60"	"judge of the county court. He was very proud of his old Virginian"
"61"	"ancestry, and in his hospitalities and his rather formal and stately"
"62"	"manners he kept up its traditions. He was fine and just and generous. To"
"63"	"be a gentleman--a gentleman without stain or blemish--was his only"
"64"	"religion, and to it he was always faithful. He was respected, esteemed"
"65"	"and beloved by all the community. He was well off, and was gradually"
"66"	"adding to his store. He and his wife were very nearly happy, but not"
"67"	"quite, for they had no children. The longing for the treasure of a child"
"68"	"had grown stronger and stronger as the years slipped away, but the"
"69"	"blessing never came--and was never to come."
"70"	"With this pair lived the Judge's widowed sister, Mrs. Rachel Pratt, and"
"71"	"she also was childless--childless, and sorrowful for that reason, and"
"72"	"not to be comforted. The women were good and commonplace people, and did"
"73"	"their duty and had their reward in clear consciences and the community's"
"74"	"approbation. They were Presbyterians, the Judge was a free-thinker."
"75"	"Pembroke Howard, lawyer and bachelor, aged about forty, was another old"
"76"	"Virginian grandee with proved descent from the First Families. He was a"
"77"	"fine, brave, majestic creature, a gentleman according to the nicest"
"78"	"requirements of the Virginia rule, a devoted Presbyterian, an authority"
"79"	"on the \"code,\" and a man always courteously ready to stand up before you"
"80"	"in the field if any act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious"
"81"	"to you, and explain it with any weapon you might prefer from brad-awls"
"82"	"to artillery. He was very popular with the people, and was the Judge's"
"83"	"dearest friend."
"84"	"Then there was Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex, another F. F. V. of"
"85"	"formidable caliber--however, with him we have no concern."
"86"	"Percy Northumberland Driscoll, brother to the Judge, and younger than he"
"87"	"by five years, was a married man, and had had children around his"
"88"	"hearthstone; but they were attacked in detail by measles, croup and"
"89"	"scarlet fever, and this had given the doctor a chance with his effective"
"90"	"antediluvian methods; so the cradles were empty. He was a prosperous"
"91"	"man, with a good head for speculations, and his fortune was growing. On"
"92"	"the 1st of February, 1830, two boy babes were born in his house: one to"
"93"	"him, the other to one of his slave girls, Roxana by name. Roxana was"
"94"	"twenty years old. She was up and around the same day, with her hands"
"95"	"full, for she was tending both babies."
"96"	"Mrs. Percy Driscoll died within the week. Roxy remained in charge of the"
"97"	"children. She had her own way, for Mr. Driscoll soon absorbed himself in"
"98"	"his speculations and left her to her own devices."
"99"	"In that same month of February, Dawson's Landing gained a new citizen."
"100"	"This was Mr. David Wilson, a young fellow of Scotch parentage. He had"
"101"	"wandered to this remote region from his birthplace in the interior of"
"102"	"the State of New York, to seek his fortune. He was twenty-five years"
"103"	"old, college-bred, and had finished a post-college course in an Eastern"
"104"	"law school a couple of years before."
"105"	"He was a homely, freckled, sandy-haired young fellow, with an"
"106"	"intelligent blue eye that had frankness and comradeship in it and a"
"107"	"covert twinkle of a pleasant sort. But for an unfortunate remark of his,"
"108"	"he would no doubt have entered at once upon a successful career at"
"109"	"Dawson's Landing. But he made his fatal remark the first day he spent in"
"110"	"the village, and it \"gaged\" him. He had just made the acquaintance of a"
"111"	"group of citizens when an invisible dog began to yelp and snarl and howl"
"112"	"and make himself very comprehensively disagreeable, whereupon young"
"113"	"Wilson said, much as one who is thinking aloud--"
"114"	"\"I wish I owned half of that dog.\""
"115"	"\"Why?\" somebody asked."
"116"	"\"Because I would kill my half.\""
"117"	"The group searched his face with curiosity, with anxiety even, but found"
"118"	"no light there, no expression that they could read. They fell away from"
"119"	"him as from something uncanny, and went into privacy to discuss him. One"
"120"	"said:"
"121"	"\"'Pears to be a fool.\""
"122"	"\"'Pears?\" said another. \"Is, I reckon you better say.\""
"123"	"\"Said he wished he owned half of the dog, the idiot,\" said a third."
"124"	"\"What did he reckon would become of the other half if he killed his"
"125"	"half? Do you reckon he thought it would live?\""
"126"	"\"Why, he must have thought it, unless he is the downrightest fool in the"
"127"	"world; because if he hadn't thought it, he would have wanted to own the"
"128"	"whole dog, knowing that if he killed his half and the other half died,"
"129"	"he would be responsible for that half just the same as if he had killed"
"130"	"that half instead of his own. Don't it look that way to you, gents?\""
"131"	"\"Yes, it does. If he owned one half of the general dog, it would be so;"
"132"	"if he owned one end of the dog and another person owned the other end,"
"133"	"it would be so, just the same; particularly in the first case, because"
"134"	"if you kill one half of a general dog, there ain't any man that can tell"
"135"	"whose half it was, but if he owned one end of the dog, maybe he could"
"136"	"kill his end of it and--\""
"137"	"\"No, he couldn't either; he couldn't and not be responsible if the other"
"138"	"end died, which it would. In my opinion that man ain't in his right"
"139"	"mind.\""
"140"	"\"In my opinion he hain't got any mind.\""
"141"	"No. 3 said: \"Well, he's a lummox, anyway.\""
"142"	"\"That's what he is,\" said No. 4, \"he's a labrick--just a Simon-pure"
"143"	"labrick, if ever there was one.\""
"144"	"\"Yes, sir, he's a dam fool, that's the way I put him up,\" said No. 5."
"145"	"\"Anybody can think different that wants to, but those are my"
"146"	"sentiments.\""
"147"	"\"I'm with you, gentlemen,\" said No. 6. \"Perfect jackass--yes, and it"
"148"	"ain't going too far to say he is a pudd'nhead. If he ain't a pudd'nhead,"
"149"	"I ain't no judge, that's all.\""
"150"	"Mr. Wilson stood elected. The incident was told all over the town, and"
"151"	"gravely discussed by everybody. Within a week he had lost his first"
"152"	"name; Pudd'nhead took its place. In time he came to be liked, and well"
"153"	"liked too; but by that time the nickname had got well stuck on, and it"
"154"	"stayed. That first day's verdict made him a fool, and he was not able to"
"155"	"get it set aside, or even modified. The nickname soon ceased to carry"
"156"	"any harsh or unfriendly feeling with it, but it held its place, and was"
"157"	"to continue to hold its place for twenty long years."
