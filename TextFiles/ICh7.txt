"1"	"CHAPTER VII."
"2"	"A week of buffeting a tempestuous and relentless sea; a week of"
"3"	"seasickness and deserted cabins; of lonely quarterdecks drenched with"
"4"	"spray--spray so ambitious that it even coated the smokestacks thick with"
"5"	"a white crust of salt to their very tops; a week of shivering in the"
"6"	"shelter of the lifeboats and deckhouses by day and blowing suffocating"
"7"	"“clouds” and boisterously performing at dominoes in the smoking room at"
"8"	"night."
"9"	"And the last night of the seven was the stormiest of all.  There was no"
"10"	"thunder, no noise but the pounding bows of the ship, the keen whistling"
"11"	"of the gale through the cordage, and the rush of the seething waters."
"12"	"But the vessel climbed aloft as if she would climb to heaven--then paused"
"13"	"an instant that seemed a century and plunged headlong down again, as from"
"14"	"a precipice.  The sheeted sprays drenched the decks like rain.  The"
"15"	"blackness of darkness was everywhere.  At long intervals a flash of"
"16"	"lightning clove it with a quivering line of fire that revealed a heaving"
"17"	"world of water where was nothing before, kindled the dusky cordage to"
"18"	"glittering silver, and lit up the faces of the men with a ghastly luster!"
"19"	"Fear drove many on deck that were used to avoiding the night winds and"
"20"	"the spray.  Some thought the vessel could not live through the night, and"
"21"	"it seemed less dreadful to stand out in the midst of the wild tempest and"
"22"	"see the peril that threatened than to be shut up in the sepulchral"
"23"	"cabins, under the dim lamps, and imagine the horrors that were abroad on"
"24"	"the ocean.  And once out--once where they could see the ship struggling"
"25"	"in the strong grasp of the storm--once where they could hear the shriek"
"26"	"of the winds and face the driving spray and look out upon the majestic"
"27"	"picture the lightnings disclosed, they were prisoners to a fierce"
"28"	"fascination they could not resist, and so remained.  It was a wild night"
"29"	"--and a very, very long one."
"30"	"Everybody was sent scampering to the deck at seven o’clock this lovely"
"31"	"morning of the thirtieth of June with the glad news that land was in"
"32"	"sight!  It was a rare thing and a joyful, to see all the ship’s family"
"33"	"abroad once more, albeit the happiness that sat upon every countenance"
"34"	"could only partly conceal the ravages which that long siege of storms had"
"35"	"wrought there.  But dull eyes soon sparkled with pleasure, pallid cheeks"
"36"	"flushed again, and frames weakened by sickness gathered new life from the"
"37"	"quickening influences of the bright, fresh morning.  Yea, and from a"
"38"	"still more potent influence: the worn castaways were to see the blessed"
"39"	"land again!--and to see it was to bring back that motherland that was in"
"40"	"all their thoughts."
"41"	"Within the hour we were fairly within the Straits of Gibraltar, the tall"
"42"	"yellow-splotched hills of Africa on our right, with their bases veiled in"
"43"	"a blue haze and their summits swathed in clouds--the same being according"
"44"	"to Scripture, which says that “clouds and darkness are over the land.”"
"45"	" The words were spoken of this particular portion of Africa, I believe."
"46"	"On our left were the granite-ribbed domes of old Spain.  The strait is"
"47"	"only thirteen miles wide in its narrowest part."
"48"	"At short intervals along the Spanish shore were quaint-looking old stone"
"49"	"towers--Moorish, we thought--but learned better afterwards.  In former"
"50"	"times the Morocco rascals used to coast along the Spanish Main in their"
"51"	"boats till a safe opportunity seemed to present itself, and then dart in"
"52"	"and capture a Spanish village and carry off all the pretty women they"
"53"	"could find.  It was a pleasant business, and was very popular.  The"
"54"	"Spaniards built these watchtowers on the hills to enable them to keep a"
"55"	"sharper lookout on the Moroccan speculators."
"56"	"The picture on the other hand was very beautiful to eyes weary of the"
"57"	"changeless sea, and by and by the ship’s company grew wonderfully"
"58"	"cheerful.  But while we stood admiring the cloud-capped peaks and the"
"59"	"lowlands robed in misty gloom a finer picture burst upon us and chained"
"60"	"every eye like a magnet--a stately ship, with canvas piled on canvas till"
"61"	"she was one towering mass of bellying sail!  She came speeding over the"
"62"	"sea like a great bird.  Africa and Spain were forgotten.  All homage was"
"63"	"for the beautiful stranger.  While everybody gazed she swept superbly by"
"64"	"and flung the Stars and Stripes to the breeze!  Quicker than thought,"
"65"	"hats and handkerchiefs flashed in the air, and a cheer went up!  She was"
"66"	"beautiful before--she was radiant now.  Many a one on our decks knew then"
"67"	"for the first time how tame a sight his country’s flag is at home"
"68"	"compared to what it is in a foreign land.  To see it is to see a vision"
"69"	"of home itself and all its idols, and feel a thrill that would stir a"
"70"	"very river of sluggish blood!"
"71"	"We were approaching the famed Pillars of Hercules, and already the"
"72"	"African one, “Ape’s Hill,” a grand old mountain with summit streaked with"
"73"	"granite ledges, was in sight.  The other, the great Rock of Gibraltar,"
"74"	"was yet to come.  The ancients considered the Pillars of Hercules the"
"75"	"head of navigation and the end of the world.  The information the"
"76"	"ancients didn’t have was very voluminous.  Even the prophets wrote book"
"77"	"after book and epistle after epistle, yet never once hinted at the"
"78"	"existence of a great continent on our side of the water; yet they must"
"79"	"have known it was there, I should think."
"80"	"In a few moments a lonely and enormous mass of rock, standing seemingly"
"81"	"in the center of the wide strait and apparently washed on all sides by"
"82"	"the sea, swung magnificently into view, and we needed no tedious traveled"
"83"	"parrot to tell us it was Gibraltar.  There could not be two rocks like"
"84"	"that in one kingdom."
"85"	"The Rock of Gibraltar is about a mile and a half long, I should say, by"
"86"	"1,400 to 1,500 feet high, and a quarter of a mile wide at its base.  One"
"87"	"side and one end of it come about as straight up out of the sea as the"
"88"	"side of a house, the other end is irregular and the other side is a steep"
"89"	"slant which an army would find very difficult to climb.  At the foot of"
"90"	"this slant is the walled town of Gibraltar--or rather the town occupies"
"91"	"part of the slant.  Everywhere--on hillside, in the precipice, by the"
"92"	"sea, on the heights--everywhere you choose to look, Gibraltar is clad"
"93"	"with masonry and bristling with guns.  It makes a striking and lively"
"94"	"picture from whatsoever point you contemplate it.  It is pushed out into"
"95"	"the sea on the end of a flat, narrow strip of land, and is suggestive of"
"96"	"a “gob” of mud on the end of a shingle.  A few hundred yards of this flat"
"97"	"ground at its base belongs to the English, and then, extending across the"
"98"	"strip from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, a distance of a quarter of"
"99"	"a mile, comes the “Neutral Ground,” a space two or three hundred yards"
"100"	"wide, which is free to both parties."
"101"	"“Are you going through Spain to Paris?”  That question was bandied about"
"102"	"the ship day and night from Fayal to Gibraltar, and I thought I never"
"103"	"could get so tired of hearing any one combination of words again or more"
"104"	"tired of answering, “I don’t know.”  At the last moment six or seven had"
"105"	"sufficient decision of character to make up their minds to go, and did"
"106"	"go, and I felt a sense of relief at once--it was forever too late now and"
"107"	"I could make up my mind at my leisure not to go.  I must have a"
"108"	"prodigious quantity of mind; it takes me as much as a week sometimes to"
"109"	"make it up."
"110"	"But behold how annoyances repeat themselves.  We had no sooner gotten rid"
"111"	"of the Spain distress than the Gibraltar guides started another--a"
"112"	"tiresome repetition of a legend that had nothing very astonishing about"
"113"	"it, even in the first place: “That high hill yonder is called the Queen’s"
"114"	"Chair; it is because one of the queens of Spain placed her chair there"
"115"	"when the French and Spanish troops were besieging Gibraltar, and said she"
"116"	"would never move from the spot till the English flag was lowered from the"
"117"	"fortresses.  If the English hadn’t been gallant enough to lower the flag"
"118"	"for a few hours one day, she’d have had to break her oath or die up"
"119"	"there.”"
"120"	"We rode on asses and mules up the steep, narrow streets and entered the"
"121"	"subterranean galleries the English have blasted out in the rock.  These"
"122"	"galleries are like spacious railway tunnels, and at short intervals in"
"123"	"them great guns frown out upon sea and town through portholes five or six"
"124"	"hundred feet above the ocean.  There is a mile or so of this subterranean"
"125"	"work, and it must have cost a vast deal of money and labor.  The gallery"
"126"	"guns command the peninsula and the harbors of both oceans, but they might"
"127"	"as well not be there, I should think, for an army could hardly climb the"
"128"	"perpendicular wall of the rock anyhow.  Those lofty portholes afford"
"129"	"superb views of the sea, though.  At one place, where a jutting crag was"
"130"	"hollowed out into a great chamber whose furniture was huge cannon and"
"131"	"whose windows were portholes, a glimpse was caught of a hill not far"
"132"	"away, and a soldier said:"
"133"	"“That high hill yonder is called the Queen’s Chair; it is because a queen"
"134"	"of Spain placed her chair there once when the French and Spanish troops"
"135"	"were besieging Gibraltar, and said she would never move from the spot"
"136"	"till the English flag was lowered from the fortresses.  If the English"
"137"	"hadn’t been gallant enough to lower the flag for a few hours one day,"
"138"	"she’d have had to break her oath or die up there.”"
"139"	"On the topmost pinnacle of Gibraltar we halted a good while, and no doubt"
"140"	"the mules were tired.  They had a right to be.  The military road was"
"141"	"good, but rather steep, and there was a good deal of it.  The view from"
"142"	"the narrow ledge was magnificent; from it vessels seeming like the"
"143"	"tiniest little toy boats were turned into noble ships by the telescopes,"
"144"	"and other vessels that were fifty miles away and even sixty, they said,"
"145"	"and invisible to the naked eye, could be clearly distinguished through"
"146"	"those same telescopes.  Below, on one side, we looked down upon an"
"147"	"endless mass of batteries and on the other straight down to the sea."
"148"	"While I was resting ever so comfortably on a rampart, and cooling my"
"149"	"baking head in the delicious breeze, an officious guide belonging to"
"150"	"another party came up and said:"
"151"	"“Senor, that high hill yonder is called the Queen’s Chair--”"
"152"	"“Sir, I am a helpless orphan in a foreign land.  Have pity on me.  Don’t"
"153"	"--now don’t inflict that most in-FERNAL old legend on me anymore today!”"
"154"	"There--I had used strong language after promising I would never do so"
"155"	"again; but the provocation was more than human nature could bear.  If you"
"156"	"had been bored so, when you had the noble panorama of Spain and Africa"
"157"	"and the blue Mediterranean spread abroad at your feet, and wanted to gaze"
"158"	"and enjoy and surfeit yourself in its beauty in silence, you might have"
"159"	"even burst into stronger language than I did."
"160"	"Gibraltar has stood several protracted sieges, one of them of nearly four"
"161"	"years’ duration (it failed), and the English only captured it by"
"162"	"stratagem.  The wonder is that anybody should ever dream of trying so"
"163"	"impossible a project as the taking it by assault--and yet it has been"
"164"	"tried more than once."
"165"	"The Moors held the place twelve hundred years ago, and a staunch old"
"166"	"castle of theirs of that date still frowns from the middle of the town,"
"167"	"with moss-grown battlements and sides well scarred by shots fired in"
"168"	"battles and sieges that are forgotten now.  A secret chamber in the rock"
"169"	"behind it was discovered some time ago, which contained a sword of"
"170"	"exquisite workmanship, and some quaint old armor of a fashion that"
"171"	"antiquaries are not acquainted with, though it is supposed to be Roman."
"172"	"Roman armor and Roman relics of various kinds have been found in a cave"
"173"	"in the sea extremity of Gibraltar; history says Rome held this part of"
"174"	"the country about the Christian era, and these things seem to confirm the"
"175"	"statement."
"176"	"In that cave also are found human bones, crusted with a very thick, stony"
"177"	"coating, and wise men have ventured to say that those men not only lived"
"178"	"before the flood, but as much as ten thousand years before it.  It may be"
"179"	"true--it looks reasonable enough--but as long as those parties can’t vote"
"180"	"anymore, the matter can be of no great public interest.  In this cave"
"181"	"likewise are found skeletons and fossils of animals that exist in every"
"182"	"part of Africa, yet within memory and tradition have never existed in any"
"183"	"portion of Spain save this lone peak of Gibraltar!  So the theory is that"
"184"	"the channel between Gibraltar and Africa was once dry land, and that the"
"185"	"low, neutral neck between Gibraltar and the Spanish hills behind it was"
"186"	"once ocean, and of course that these African animals, being over at"
"187"	"Gibraltar (after rock, perhaps--there is plenty there), got closed out"
"188"	"when the great change occurred.  The hills in Africa, across the channel,"
"189"	"are full of apes, and there are now and always have been apes on the rock"
"190"	"of Gibraltar--but not elsewhere in Spain!  The subject is an interesting"
"191"	"one."
"192"	"There is an English garrison at Gibraltar of 6,000 or 7,000 men, and so"
"193"	"uniforms of flaming red are plenty; and red and blue, and undress"
"194"	"costumes of snowy white, and also the queer uniform of the bare-kneed"
"195"	"Highlander; and one sees soft-eyed Spanish girls from San Roque, and"
"196"	"veiled Moorish beauties (I suppose they are beauties) from Tarifa, and"
"197"	"turbaned, sashed, and trousered Moorish merchants from Fez, and"
"198"	"long-robed, bare-legged, ragged Muhammadan vagabonds from Tetuan and"
"199"	"Tangier, some brown, some yellow and some as black as virgin ink--and"
"200"	"Jews from all around, in gabardine, skullcap, and slippers, just as they"
"201"	"are in pictures and theaters, and just as they were three thousand years"
"202"	"ago, no doubt.  You can easily understand that a tribe (somehow our"
"203"	"pilgrims suggest that expression, because they march in a straggling"
"204"	"procession through these foreign places with such an Indian-like air of"
"205"	"complacency and independence about them) like ours, made up from fifteen"
"206"	"or sixteen states of the Union, found enough to stare at in this"
"207"	"shifting panorama of fashion today."
"208"	"Speaking of our pilgrims reminds me that we have one or two people among"
"209"	"us who are sometimes an annoyance.  However, I do not count the Oracle in"
"210"	"that list.  I will explain that the Oracle is an innocent old ass who"
"211"	"eats for four and looks wiser than the whole Academy of France would have"
"212"	"any right to look, and never uses a one-syllable word when he can think"
"213"	"of a longer one, and never by any possible chance knows the meaning of"
"214"	"any long word he uses or ever gets it in the right place; yet he will"
"215"	"serenely venture an opinion on the most abstruse subject and back it up"
"216"	"complacently with quotations from authors who never existed, and finally"
"217"	"when cornered will slide to the other side of the question, say he has"
"218"	"been there all the time, and come back at you with your own spoken"
"219"	"arguments, only with the big words all tangled, and play them in your"
"220"	"very teeth as original with himself.  He reads a chapter in the"
"221"	"guidebooks, mixes the facts all up, with his bad memory, and then goes"
"222"	"off to inflict the whole mess on somebody as wisdom which has been"
"223"	"festering in his brain for years and which he gathered in college from"
"224"	"erudite authors who are dead now and out of print.  This morning at"
"225"	"breakfast he pointed out of the window and said:"
"226"	"“Do you see that there hill out there on that African coast?  It’s one of"
"227"	"them Pillows of Herkewls, I should say--and there’s the ultimate one"
"228"	"alongside of it.”"
"229"	"“The ultimate one--that is a good word--but the pillars are not both on"
"230"	"the same side of the strait.”  (I saw he had been deceived by a"
"231"	"carelessly written sentence in the guidebook.)"
"232"	"“Well, it ain’t for you to say, nor for me.  Some authors states it that"
"233"	"way, and some states it different.  Old Gibbons don’t say nothing about"
"234"	"it--just shirks it complete--Gibbons always done that when he got stuck"
"235"	"--but there is Rolampton, what does he say?  Why, he says that they was"
"236"	"both on the same side, and Trinculian, and Sobaster, and Syraccus, and"
"237"	"Langomarganbl----”"
"238"	"“Oh, that will do--that’s enough.  If you have got your hand in for"
"239"	"inventing authors and testimony, I have nothing more to say--let them be"
"240"	"on the same side.”"
"241"	"We don’t mind the Oracle.  We rather like him.  We can tolerate the"
"242"	"Oracle very easily, but we have a poet and a good-natured enterprising"
"243"	"idiot on board, and they do distress the company.  The one gives copies"
"244"	"of his verses to consuls, commanders, hotel keepers, Arabs, Dutch--to"
"245"	"anybody, in fact, who will submit to a grievous infliction most kindly"
"246"	"meant.  His poetry is all very well on shipboard, notwithstanding when he"
"247"	"wrote an “Ode to the Ocean in a Storm” in one half hour, and an"
"248"	"“Apostrophe to the Rooster in the Waist of the Ship” in the next, the"
"249"	"transition was considered to be rather abrupt; but when he sends an"
"250"	"invoice of rhymes to the Governor of Fayal and another to the commander"
"251"	"in chief and other dignitaries in Gibraltar with the compliments of the"
"252"	"Laureate of the Ship, it is not popular with the passengers."
"253"	"The other personage I have mentioned is young and green, and not bright,"
"254"	"not learned, and not wise.  He will be, though, someday if he recollects"
"255"	"the answers to all his questions.  He is known about the ship as the"
"256"	"“Interrogation Point,” and this by constant use has become shortened to"
"257"	"“Interrogation.”  He has distinguished himself twice already.  In Fayal"
"258"	"they pointed out a hill and told him it was 800 feet high and 1,100 feet"
"259"	"long.  And they told him there was a tunnel 2,000 feet long and 1,000"
"260"	"feet high running through the hill, from end to end.  He believed it.  He"
"261"	"repeated it to everybody, discussed it, and read it from his notes."
"262"	"Finally, he took a useful hint from this remark, which a thoughtful old"
"263"	"pilgrim made:"
"264"	"“Well, yes, it is a little remarkable--singular tunnel altogether--stands"
"265"	"up out of the top of the hill about two hundred feet, and one end of it"
"266"	"sticks out of the hill about nine hundred!”"
"267"	"Here in Gibraltar he corners these educated British officers and badgers"
"268"	"them with braggadocio about America and the wonders she can perform!  He"
"269"	"told one of them a couple of our gunboats could come here and knock"
"270"	"Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea!"
"271"	"At this present moment half a dozen of us are taking a private pleasure"
"272"	"excursion of our own devising.  We form rather more than half the list of"
"273"	"white passengers on board a small steamer bound for the venerable Moorish"
"274"	"town of Tangier, Africa.  Nothing could be more absolutely certain than"
"275"	"that we are enjoying ourselves.  One can not do otherwise who speeds over"
"276"	"these sparkling waters and breathes the soft atmosphere of this sunny"
"277"	"land.  Care cannot assail us here.  We are out of its jurisdiction."
"278"	"We even steamed recklessly by the frowning fortress of Malabat"
"279"	"(a stronghold of the Emperor of Morocco) without a twinge of fear."
"280"	"The whole garrison turned out under arms and assumed a threatening"
"281"	"attitude--yet still we did not fear.  The entire garrison marched and"
"282"	"counter-marched within the rampart, in full view--yet notwithstanding"
"283"	"even this, we never flinched."
"284"	"I suppose we really do not know what fear is.  I inquired the name of the"
"285"	"garrison of the fortress of Malabat, and they said it was Mehemet Ali Ben"
"286"	"Sancom.  I said it would be a good idea to get some more garrisons to"
"287"	"help him; but they said no, he had nothing to do but hold the place, and"
"288"	"he was competent to do that, had done it two years already.  That was"
"289"	"evidence which one could not well refute.  There is nothing like"
"290"	"reputation."
"291"	"Every now and then my glove purchase in Gibraltar last night intrudes"
"292"	"itself upon me.  Dan and the ship’s surgeon and I had been up to the"
"293"	"great square, listening to the music of the fine military bands and"
"294"	"contemplating English and Spanish female loveliness and fashion, and at"
"295"	"nine o’clock were on our way to the theater, when we met the General, the"
"296"	"Judge, the Commodore, the Colonel, and the Commissioner of the United"
"297"	"States of America to Europe, Asia, and Africa, who had been to the Club"
"298"	"House to register their several titles and impoverish the bill of fare;"
"299"	"and they told us to go over to the little variety store near the Hall of"
"300"	"Justice and buy some kid gloves.  They said they were elegant and very"
"301"	"moderate in price.  It seemed a stylish thing to go to the theater in kid"
"302"	"gloves, and we acted upon the hint.  A very handsome young lady in the"
"303"	"store offered me a pair of blue gloves.  I did not want blue, but she"
"304"	"said they would look very pretty on a hand like mine.  The remark touched"
"305"	"me tenderly.  I glanced furtively at my hand, and somehow it did seem"
"306"	"rather a comely member.  I tried a glove on my left and blushed a little."
"307"	"Manifestly the size was too small for me.  But I felt gratified when she"
"308"	"said:"
"309"	"“Oh, it is just right!”  Yet I knew it was no such thing."
"310"	"I tugged at it diligently, but it was discouraging work.  She said:"
"311"	"“Ah!  I see you are accustomed to wearing kid gloves--but some gentlemen"
"312"	"are so awkward about putting them on.”"
"313"	"It was the last compliment I had expected.  I only understand putting on"
"314"	"the buckskin article perfectly.  I made another effort and tore the glove"
"315"	"from the base of the thumb into the palm of the hand--and tried to hide"
"316"	"the rent.  She kept up her compliments, and I kept up my determination to"
"317"	"deserve them or die:"
"318"	"“Ah, you have had experience!  [A rip down the back of the hand.] They"
"319"	"are just right for you--your hand is very small--if they tear you need"
"320"	"not pay for them.  [A rent across the middle.]  I can always tell when a"
"321"	"gentleman understands putting on kid gloves.  There is a grace about it"
"322"	"that only comes with long practice.”  The whole after-guard of the glove"
"323"	"“fetched away,” as the sailors say, the fabric parted across the"
"324"	"knuckles, and nothing was left but a melancholy ruin."
"325"	"I was too much flattered to make an exposure and throw the merchandise on"
"326"	"the angel’s hands.  I was hot, vexed, confused, but still happy; but I"
"327"	"hated the other boys for taking such an absorbing interest in the"
"328"	"proceedings.  I wished they were in Jericho.  I felt exquisitely mean"
"329"	"when I said cheerfully:"
"330"	"“This one does very well; it fits elegantly.  I like a glove that fits."
"331"	"No, never mind, ma’am, never mind; I’ll put the other on in the street."
"332"	"It is warm here.”"
"333"	"It was warm.  It was the warmest place I ever was in.  I paid the bill,"
"334"	"and as I passed out with a fascinating bow I thought I detected a light"
"335"	"in the woman’s eye that was gently ironical; and when I looked back from"
"336"	"the street, and she was laughing all to herself about something or other,"
"337"	"I said to myself with withering sarcasm, “Oh, certainly; you know how to"
"338"	"put on kid gloves, don’t you?  A self-complacent ass, ready to be"
"339"	"flattered out of your senses by every petticoat that chooses to take the"
"340"	"trouble to do it!”"
"341"	"The silence of the boys annoyed me.  Finally Dan said musingly:"
"342"	"“Some gentlemen don’t know how to put on kid gloves at all, but some do.”"
"343"	"And the doctor said (to the moon, I thought):"
"344"	"“But it is always easy to tell when a gentleman is used to putting on kid"
"345"	"gloves.”"
"346"	"Dan soliloquized after a pause:"
"347"	"“Ah, yes; there is a grace about it that only comes with long, very long"
"348"	"practice.”"
"349"	"“Yes, indeed, I’ve noticed that when a man hauls on a kid glove like he"
"350"	"was dragging a cat out of an ash hole by the tail, he understands putting"
"351"	"on kid gloves; he’s had ex--”"
"352"	"“Boys, enough of a thing’s enough!  You think you are very smart, I"

"354"	"the ship about this thing, I’ll never forgive you for it; that’s all.”"
"355"	"They let me alone then for the time being.  We always let each other"
"356"	"alone in time to prevent ill feeling from spoiling a joke.  But they had"
"357"	"bought gloves, too, as I did.  We threw all the purchases away together"
"358"	"this morning.  They were coarse, unsubstantial, freckled all over with"
"359"	"broad yellow splotches, and could neither stand wear nor public"
"360"	"exhibition.  We had entertained an angel unawares, but we did not take"
"361"	"her in.  She did that for us."
"362"	"Tangier!  A tribe of stalwart Moors are wading into the sea to carry us"
"363"	"ashore on their backs from the small boats."
