"1"	"CHAPTER XXXIII."
"2"	"I do not know how long I was in a state of forgetfulness, but it seemed"
"3"	"an age.  A vague consciousness grew upon me by degrees, and then came a"
"4"	"gathering anguish of pain in my limbs and through all my body.  I"
"5"	"shuddered.  The thought flitted through my brain, “this is death--this is"
"6"	"the hereafter.”"
"7"	"Then came a white upheaval at my side, and a voice said, with bitterness:"
"8"	"“Will some gentleman be so good as to kick me behind?”"
"9"	"It was Ballou--at least it was a towzled snow image in a sitting posture,"
"10"	"with Ballou’s voice."
"11"	"I rose up, and there in the gray dawn, not fifteen steps from us, were"
"12"	"the frame buildings of a stage station, and under a shed stood our still"
"13"	"saddled and bridled horses!"
"14"	"An arched snow-drift broke up, now, and Ollendorff emerged from it, and"
"15"	"the three of us sat and stared at the houses without speaking a word."
"16"	"We really had nothing to say.  We were like the profane man who could not"
"17"	"“do the subject justice,” the whole situation was so painfully ridiculous"
"18"	"and humiliating that words were tame and we did not know where to"
"19"	"commence anyhow."
"20"	"The joy in our hearts at our deliverance was poisoned; well-nigh"
"21"	"dissipated, indeed.  We presently began to grow pettish by degrees, and"
"22"	"sullen; and then, angry at each other, angry at ourselves, angry at"
"23"	"everything in general, we moodily dusted the snow from our clothing and"
"24"	"in unsociable single file plowed our way to the horses, unsaddled them,"
"25"	"and sought shelter in the station."
"26"	"I have scarcely exaggerated a detail of this curious and absurd"
"27"	"adventure.  It occurred almost exactly as I have stated it.  We actually"
"28"	"went into camp in a snow-drift in a desert, at midnight in a storm,"
"29"	"forlorn and hopeless, within fifteen steps of a comfortable inn."
"30"	"For two hours we sat apart in the station and ruminated in disgust."
"31"	"The mystery was gone, now, and it was plain enough why the horses had"
"32"	"deserted us.  Without a doubt they were under that shed a quarter of a"
"33"	"minute after they had left us, and they must have overheard and enjoyed"
"34"	"all our confessions and lamentations."
"35"	"After breakfast we felt better, and the zest of life soon came back."
"36"	"The world looked bright again, and existence was as dear to us as ever."
"37"	"Presently an uneasiness came over me--grew upon me--assailed me without"
"38"	"ceasing.  Alas, my regeneration was not complete--I wanted to smoke!"
"39"	"I resisted with all my strength, but the flesh was weak.  I wandered away"
"40"	"alone and wrestled with myself an hour.  I recalled my promises of reform"
"41"	"and preached to myself persuasively, upbraidingly, exhaustively.  But it"
"42"	"was all vain, I shortly found myself sneaking among the snow-drifts"
"43"	"hunting for my pipe.  I discovered it after a considerable search, and"
"44"	"crept away to hide myself and enjoy it.  I remained behind the barn a"
"45"	"good while, asking myself how I would feel if my braver, stronger, truer"
"46"	"comrades should catch me in my degradation.  At last I lit the pipe, and"
"47"	"no human being can feel meaner and baser than I did then.  I was ashamed"
"48"	"of being in my own pitiful company.  Still dreading discovery, I felt"
"49"	"that perhaps the further side of the barn would be somewhat safer, and so"
"50"	"I turned the corner.  As I turned the one corner, smoking, Ollendorff"
"51"	"turned the other with his bottle to his lips, and between us sat"
"52"	"unconscious Ballou deep in a game of “solitaire” with the old greasy"
"53"	"cards!"
"54"	"Absurdity could go no farther.  We shook hands and agreed to say no more"
"55"	"about “reform” and “examples to the rising generation.”"
"56"	"The station we were at was at the verge of the Twenty-six-Mile Desert."
"57"	"If we had approached it half an hour earlier the night before, we must"
"58"	"have heard men shouting there and firing pistols; for they were expecting"
"59"	"some sheep drovers and their flocks and knew that they would infallibly"
"60"	"get lost and wander out of reach of help unless guided by sounds."
"61"	"While we remained at the station, three of the drovers arrived, nearly"
"62"	"exhausted with their wanderings, but two others of their party were never"
"63"	"heard of afterward."
"64"	"We reached Carson in due time, and took a rest.  This rest, together with"
"65"	"preparations for the journey to Esmeralda, kept us there a week, and the"
"66"	"delay gave us the opportunity to be present at the trial of the great"
"67"	"land-slide case of Hyde vs. Morgan--an episode which is famous in Nevada"
"68"	"to this day.  After a word or two of necessary explanation, I will set"
"69"	"down the history of this singular affair just as it transpired."
"70"	"CHAPTER XXXIV."
