"1"	"CHAPTER XXIV."
"2"	"NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in"
"3"	"the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the"
"4"	"duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.  Jim"
"5"	"he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn’t take but a few"
"6"	"hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to"
"7"	"lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.  You see, when we left him"
"8"	"all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all"
"9"	"by himself and not tied it wouldn’t look much like he was a runaway"
"10"	"nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay"
"11"	"roped all day, and he’d cipher out some way to get around it."
"12"	"He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  He dressed"
"13"	"Jim up in King Lear’s outfit--it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a"
"14"	"white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint"
"15"	"and painted Jim’s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,"
"16"	"dull, solid blue, like a man that’s been drownded nine days.  Blamed if"
"17"	"he warn’t the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.  Then the duke took"
"18"	"and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:"
"19"	"Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head."
"20"	"And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five"
"21"	"foot in front of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied.  He said it was a sight"
"22"	"better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all"
"23"	"over every time there was a sound.  The duke told him to make himself"
"24"	"free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop"
"25"	"out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like"
"26"	"a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone."
"27"	" Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he"
"28"	"wouldn’t wait for him to howl.  Why, he didn’t only look like he was"
"29"	"dead, he looked considerable more than that."
"30"	"These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was"
"31"	"so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn’t be safe, because maybe"
"32"	"the news might a worked along down by this time.  They couldn’t hit no"
"33"	"project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he’d"
"34"	"lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn’t put up"
"35"	"something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop"
"36"	"over to t’other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence"
"37"	"to lead him the profitable way--meaning the devil, I reckon.  We had all"
"38"	"bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his’n"
"39"	"on, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it, of course.  The king’s"
"40"	"duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.  I never"
"41"	"knowed how clothes could change a body before.  Why, before, he looked"
"42"	"like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he’d take off"
"43"	"his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand"
"44"	"and good and pious that you’d say he had walked right out of the ark,"
"45"	"and maybe was old Leviticus himself.  Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I"
"46"	"got my paddle ready.  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away"
"47"	"up under the point, about three mile above the town--been there a couple"
"48"	"of hours, taking on freight.  Says the king:"
"49"	"“Seein’ how I’m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St."
"50"	"Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place.  Go for the steamboat,"
"51"	"Huckleberry; we’ll come down to the village on her.”"
"52"	"I didn’t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride."
"53"	" I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went"
"54"	"scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water.  Pretty soon we come to"
"55"	"a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the"
"56"	"sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a"
"57"	"couple of big carpet-bags by him."
"58"	"“Run her nose in shore,” says the king.  I done it.  “Wher’ you bound"
"59"	"for, young man?”"
"60"	"“For the steamboat; going to Orleans.”"
"61"	"“Git aboard,” says the king.  “Hold on a minute, my servant ‘ll he’p you"
"62"	"with them bags.  Jump out and he’p the gentleman, Adolphus”--meaning me,"
"63"	"I see."
"64"	"I done so, and then we all three started on again.  The young chap was"
"65"	"mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather."
"66"	"He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he’d come"
"67"	"down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he"
"68"	"was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there.  The"
"69"	"young fellow says:"
"70"	"“When I first see you I says to myself, ‘It’s Mr. Wilks, sure, and he"
"71"	"come mighty near getting here in time.’  But then I says again, ‘No, I"
"72"	"reckon it ain’t him, or else he wouldn’t be paddling up the river.’  You"
"73"	"_ain’t_ him, are you?”"
"74"	"“No, my name’s Blodgett--Elexander Blodgett--_Reverend_ Elexander"
"75"	"Blodgett, I s’pose I must say, as I’m one o’ the Lord’s poor servants."
"76"	" But still I’m jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving"
"77"	"in time, all the same, if he’s missed anything by it--which I hope he"
"78"	"hasn’t.”"
"79"	"“Well, he don’t miss any property by it, because he’ll get that all"
"80"	"right; but he’s missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn’t"
"81"	"mind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would a give anything"
"82"	"in this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothing"
"83"	"else all these three weeks; hadn’t seen him since they was boys"
"84"	"together--and hadn’t ever seen his brother William at all--that’s the deef"
"85"	"and dumb one--William ain’t more than thirty or thirty-five.  Peter and"
"86"	"George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married"
"87"	"brother; him and his wife both died last year.  Harvey and William’s the"
"88"	"only ones that’s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven’t got here"
"89"	"in time.”"
"90"	"“Did anybody send ‘em word?”"
"91"	"“Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter"
"92"	"said then that he sorter felt like he warn’t going to get well this"
"93"	"time. You see, he was pretty old, and George’s g’yirls was too young to"
"94"	"be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and so he"
"95"	"was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn’t seem"
"96"	"to care much to live.  He most desperately wanted to see Harvey--and"
"97"	"William, too, for that matter--because he was one of them kind that can’t"
"98"	"bear to make a will.  He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he’d"
"99"	"told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the"
"100"	"property divided up so George’s g’yirls would be all right--for George"
"101"	"didn’t leave nothing.  And that letter was all they could get him to put"
"102"	"a pen to.”"
"103"	"“Why do you reckon Harvey don’t come?  Wher’ does he live?”"
"104"	"“Oh, he lives in England--Sheffield--preaches there--hasn’t ever been in"
"105"	"this country.  He hasn’t had any too much time--and besides he mightn’t a"
"106"	"got the letter at all, you know.”"
"107"	"“Too bad, too bad he couldn’t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul."
"108"	"You going to Orleans, you say?”"
"109"	"“Yes, but that ain’t only a part of it.  I’m going in a ship, next"
"110"	"Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.”"
"111"	"“It’s a pretty long journey.  But it’ll be lovely; wisht I was a-going."
"112"	"Is Mary Jane the oldest?  How old is the others?”"
"113"	"“Mary Jane’s nineteen, Susan’s fifteen, and Joanna’s about"
"114"	"fourteen--that’s the one that gives herself to good works and has a"
"115"	"hare-lip.”"
"116"	"“Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.”"
"117"	"“Well, they could be worse off.  Old Peter had friends, and they"
"118"	"ain’t going to let them come to no harm.  There’s Hobson, the Babtis’"
"119"	"preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,"
"120"	"and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the"
"121"	"widow Bartley, and--well, there’s a lot of them; but these are the ones"
"122"	"that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when"
"123"	"he wrote home; so Harvey ‘ll know where to look for friends when he gets"
"124"	"here.”"
"125"	"Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied"
"126"	"that young fellow.  Blamed if he didn’t inquire about everybody and"
"127"	"everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about"
"128"	"Peter’s business--which was a tanner; and about George’s--which was a"
"129"	"carpenter; and about Harvey’s--which was a dissentering minister; and so"
"130"	"on, and so on.  Then he says:"
"131"	"“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”"
"132"	"“Because she’s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn’t stop"
"133"	"there.  When they’re deep they won’t stop for a hail.  A Cincinnati boat"
"134"	"will, but this is a St. Louis one.”"
"135"	"“Was Peter Wilks well off?”"
"136"	"“Oh, yes, pretty well off.  He had houses and land, and it’s reckoned he"
"137"	"left three or four thousand in cash hid up som’ers.”"
"138"	"“When did you say he died?”"
"139"	"“I didn’t say, but it was last night.”"
"140"	"“Funeral to-morrow, likely?”"
"141"	"“Yes, ‘bout the middle of the day.”"
"142"	"“Well, it’s all terrible sad; but we’ve all got to go, one time or"
"143"	"another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we’re all right.”"
"144"	"“Yes, sir, it’s the best way.  Ma used to always say that.”"
"145"	"When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she"
"146"	"got off.  The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost"
"147"	"my ride, after all.  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up"
"148"	"another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:"
"149"	"“Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new"
"150"	"carpet-bags.  And if he’s gone over to t’other side, go over there and"
"151"	"git him.  And tell him to git himself up regardless.  Shove along, now.”"
"152"	"I see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.  When"
"153"	"I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a"
"154"	"log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had"
"155"	"said it--every last word of it.  And all the time he was a-doing it he"
"156"	"tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for"
"157"	"a slouch. I can’t imitate him, and so I ain’t a-going to try to; but he"
"158"	"really done it pretty good.  Then he says:"
"159"	"“How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?”"
"160"	"The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef"
"161"	"and dumb person on the histronic boards.  So then they waited for a"
"162"	"steamboat."
"163"	"About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,"
"164"	"but they didn’t come from high enough up the river; but at last there"
"165"	"was a big one, and they hailed her.  She sent out her yawl, and we went"
"166"	"aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted"
"167"	"to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and"
"168"	"said they wouldn’t land us.  But the king was ca’m.  He says:"
"169"	"“If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and"
"170"	"put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry ‘em, can’t it?”"
"171"	"So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the"
"172"	"village they yawled us ashore.  About two dozen men flocked down when"
"173"	"they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:"
"174"	"“Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher’ Mr. Peter Wilks lives?” they"
"175"	"give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say,"
"176"	"“What d’ I tell you?”  Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:"
"177"	"“I’m sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_"
"178"	"live yesterday evening.”"
"179"	"Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up"
"180"	"against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his"
"181"	"back, and says:"
"182"	"“Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh,"
"183"	"it’s too, too hard!”"
"184"	"Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to"
"185"	"the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn’t drop a carpet-bag and"
"186"	"bust out a-crying.  If they warn’t the beatenest lot, them two frauds,"
"187"	"that ever I struck."
"188"	"Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all"
"189"	"sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill"
"190"	"for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about"
"191"	"his brother’s last moments, and the king he told it all over again on"
"192"	"his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner"
"193"	"like they’d lost the twelve disciples.  Well, if ever I struck anything"
"194"	"like it, I’m a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human"
"195"	"race."
