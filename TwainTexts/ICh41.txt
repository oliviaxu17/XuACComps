"1"	"CHAPTER XLI."
"2"	"When I last made a memorandum, we were at Ephesus.  We are in Syria, now,"
"3"	"encamped in the mountains of Lebanon.  The interregnum has been long,"
"4"	"both as to time and distance.  We brought not a relic from Ephesus!"
"5"	"After gathering up fragments of sculptured marbles and breaking ornaments"
"6"	"from the interior work of the Mosques; and after bringing them at a cost"
"7"	"of infinite trouble and fatigue, five miles on muleback to the railway"
"8"	"depot, a government officer compelled all who had such things to"
"9"	"disgorge!  He had an order from Constantinople to look out for our party,"
"10"	"and see that we carried nothing off.  It was a wise, a just, and a"
"11"	"well-deserved rebuke, but it created a sensation.  I never resist a"
"12"	"temptation to plunder a stranger’s premises without feeling insufferably"
"13"	"vain about it.  This time I felt proud beyond expression.  I was serene"
"14"	"in the midst of the scoldings that were heaped upon the Ottoman"
"15"	"government for its affront offered to a pleasuring party of entirely"
"16"	"respectable gentlemen and ladies I said, “We that have free souls, it"
"17"	"touches us not.”  The shoe not only pinched our party, but it pinched"
"18"	"hard; a principal sufferer discovered that the imperial order was"
"19"	"inclosed in an envelop bearing the seal of the British Embassy at"
"20"	"Constantinople, and therefore must have been inspired by the"
"21"	"representative of the Queen.  This was bad--very bad.  Coming solely"
"22"	"from the Ottomans, it might have signified only Ottoman hatred of"
"23"	"Christians, and a vulgar ignorance as to genteel methods of expressing"
"24"	"it; but coming from the Christianized, educated, politic British"
"25"	"legation, it simply intimated that we were a sort of gentlemen and"
"26"	"ladies who would bear watching!  So the party regarded it, and were"
"27"	"incensed accordingly.  The truth doubtless was, that the same"
"28"	"precautions would have been taken against any travelers, because the"
"29"	"English Company who have acquired the right to excavate Ephesus, and"
"30"	"have paid a great sum for that right, need to be protected, and deserve"
"31"	"to be. They can not afford to run the risk of having their hospitality"
"32"	"abused by travelers, especially since travelers are such notorious"
"33"	"scorners of honest behavior."
"34"	"We sailed from Smyrna, in the wildest spirit of expectancy, for the chief"
"35"	"feature, the grand goal of the expedition, was near at hand--we were"
"36"	"approaching the Holy Land!  Such a burrowing into the hold for trunks"
"37"	"that had lain buried for weeks, yes for months; such a hurrying to and"
"38"	"fro above decks and below; such a riotous system of packing and"
"39"	"unpacking; such a littering up of the cabins with shirts and skirts, and"
"40"	"indescribable and unclassable odds and ends; such a making up of bundles,"
"41"	"and setting apart of umbrellas, green spectacles and thick veils; such a"
"42"	"critical inspection of saddles and bridles that had never yet touched"
"43"	"horses; such a cleaning and loading of revolvers and examining of"
"44"	"bowie-knives; such a half-soling of the seats of pantaloons with"
"45"	"serviceable buckskin; then such a poring over ancient maps; such a"
"46"	"reading up of Bibles and Palestine travels; such a marking out of"
"47"	"routes; such exasperating efforts to divide up the company into little"
"48"	"bands of congenial spirits who might make the long and arduous Journey"
"49"	"without quarreling; and morning, noon and night, such mass-meetings in"
"50"	"the cabins, such speech-making, such sage suggesting, such worrying and"
"51"	"quarreling, and such a general raising of the very mischief, was never"
"52"	"seen in the ship before!"
"53"	"But it is all over now.  We are cut up into parties of six or eight, and"
"54"	"by this time are scattered far and wide.  Ours is the only one, however,"
"55"	"that is venturing on what is called “the long trip”--that is, out into"
"56"	"Syria, by Baalbec to Damascus, and thence down through the full length of"
"57"	"Palestine.  It would be a tedious, and also a too risky journey, at this"
"58"	"hot season of the year, for any but strong, healthy men, accustomed"
"59"	"somewhat to fatigue and rough life in the open air.  The other parties"
"60"	"will take shorter journeys."
"61"	"For the last two months we have been in a worry about one portion of this"
"62"	"Holy Land pilgrimage.  I refer to transportation service.  We knew very"
"63"	"well that Palestine was a country which did not do a large passenger"
"64"	"business, and every man we came across who knew any thing about it gave"
"65"	"us to understand that not half of our party would be able to get dragomen"
"66"	"and animals.  At Constantinople every body fell to telegraphing the"
"67"	"American Consuls at Alexandria and Beirout to give notice that we wanted"
"68"	"dragomen and transportation.  We were desperate--would take horses,"
"69"	"jackasses, cameleopards, kangaroos--any thing.  At Smyrna, more"
"70"	"telegraphing was done, to the same end.  Also fearing for the worst, we"
"71"	"telegraphed for a large number of seats in the diligence for Damascus,"
"72"	"and horses for the ruins of Baalbec."
"73"	"As might have been expected, a notion got abroad in Syria and Egypt that"
"74"	"the whole population of the Province of America (the Turks consider us a"
"75"	"trifling little province in some unvisited corner of the world,) were"
"76"	"coming to the Holy Land--and so, when we got to Beirout yesterday, we"
"77"	"found the place full of dragomen and their outfits.  We had all intended"
"78"	"to go by diligence to Damascus, and switch off to Baalbec as we went"
"79"	"along--because we expected to rejoin the ship, go to Mount Carmel, and"
"80"	"take to the woods from there.  However, when our own private party of"
"81"	"eight found that it was possible, and proper enough, to make the “long"
"82"	"trip,” we adopted that programme.  We have never been much trouble to a"
"83"	"Consul before, but we have been a fearful nuisance to our Consul at"
"84"	"Beirout.  I mention this because I can not help admiring his patience,"
"85"	"his industry, and his accommodating spirit.  I mention it also, because I"
"86"	"think some of our ship’s company did not give him as full credit for his"
"87"	"excellent services as he deserved."
"88"	"Well, out of our eight, three were selected to attend to all business"
"89"	"connected with the expedition.  The rest of us had nothing to do but look"
"90"	"at the beautiful city of Beirout, with its bright, new houses nestled"
"91"	"among a wilderness of green shrubbery spread abroad over an upland that"
"92"	"sloped gently down to the sea; and also at the mountains of Lebanon that"
"93"	"environ it; and likewise to bathe in the transparent blue water that"
"94"	"rolled its billows about the ship (we did not know there were sharks"
"95"	"there.) We had also to range up and down through the town and look at the"
"96"	"costumes.  These are picturesque and fanciful, but not so varied as at"
"97"	"Constantinople and Smyrna; the women of Beirout add an agony--in the two"
"98"	"former cities the sex wear a thin veil which one can see through (and"
"99"	"they often expose their ancles,) but at Beirout they cover their entire"
"100"	"faces with dark-colored or black veils, so that they look like mummies,"
"101"	"and then expose their breasts to the public.  A young gentleman (I"
"102"	"believe he was a Greek,) volunteered to show us around the city, and said"
"103"	"it would afford him great pleasure, because he was studying English and"
"104"	"wanted practice in that language.  When we had finished the rounds,"
"105"	"however, he called for remuneration--said he hoped the gentlemen would"
"106"	"give him a trifle in the way of a few piastres (equivalent to a few five"
"107"	"cent pieces.)  We did so.  The Consul was surprised when he heard it, and"
"108"	"said he knew the young fellow’s family very well, and that they were an"
"109"	"old and highly respectable family and worth a hundred and fifty thousand"
"110"	"dollars!  Some people, so situated, would have been ashamed of the berth"
"111"	"he had with us and his manner of crawling into it."
"112"	"At the appointed time our business committee reported, and said all"
"113"	"things were in readdress--that we were to start to-day, with horses, pack"
"114"	"animals, and tents, and go to Baalbec, Damascus, the Sea of Tiberias, and"
"115"	"thence southward by the way of the scene of Jacob’s Dream and other"
"116"	"notable Bible localities to Jerusalem--from thence probably to the Dead"
"117"	"Sea, but possibly not--and then strike for the ocean and rejoin the ship"
"118"	"three or four weeks hence at Joppa; terms, five dollars a day apiece, in"
"119"	"gold, and every thing to be furnished by the dragoman.  They said we"
"120"	"would lie as well as at a hotel.  I had read something like that before,"
"121"	"and did not shame my judgment by believing a word of it.  I said nothing,"
"122"	"however, but packed up a blanket and a shawl to sleep in, pipes and"
"123"	"tobacco, two or three woollen shirts, a portfolio, a guide-book, and a"
"124"	"Bible.  I also took along a towel and a cake of soap, to inspire respect"
"125"	"in the Arabs, who would take me for a king in disguise."
"126"	"We were to select our horses at 3 P.M.  At that hour Abraham, the"
"127"	"dragoman, marshaled them before us.  With all solemnity I set it down"
"128"	"here, that those horses were the hardest lot I ever did come across, and"
"129"	"their accoutrements were in exquisite keeping with their style.  One"
"130"	"brute had an eye out; another had his tail sawed off close, like a"
"131"	"rabbit, and was proud of it; another had a bony ridge running from his"
"132"	"neck to his tail, like one of those ruined aqueducts one sees about Rome,"
"133"	"and had a neck on him like a bowsprit; they all limped, and had sore"
"134"	"backs, and likewise raw places and old scales scattered about their"
"135"	"persons like brass nails in a hair trunk; their gaits were marvelous to"
"136"	"contemplate, and replete with variety under way the procession looked"
"137"	"like a fleet in a storm.  It was fearful.  Blucher shook his head and"
"138"	"said:"
"139"	"“That dragon is going to get himself into trouble fetching these old"
"140"	"crates out of the hospital the way they are, unless he has got a permit.”"
"141"	"I said nothing.  The display was exactly according to the guide-book, and"
"142"	"were we not traveling by the guide-book?  I selected a certain horse"
"143"	"because I thought I saw him shy, and I thought that a horse that had"
"144"	"spirit enough to shy was not to be despised."
"145"	"At 6 o’clock P.M., we came to a halt here on the breezy summit of a"
"146"	"shapely mountain overlooking the sea, and the handsome valley where dwelt"
"147"	"some of those enterprising Phoenicians of ancient times we read so much"
"148"	"about; all around us are what were once the dominions of Hiram, King of"
"149"	"Tyre, who furnished timber from the cedars of these Lebanon hills to"
"150"	"build portions of King Solomon’s Temple with."
"151"	"Shortly after six, our pack train arrived.  I had not seen it before, and"
"152"	"a good right I had to be astonished.  We had nineteen serving men and"
"153"	"twenty-six pack mules!  It was a perfect caravan.  It looked like one,"
"154"	"too, as it wound among the rocks.  I wondered what in the very mischief"
"155"	"we wanted with such a vast turn-out as that, for eight men.  I wondered"
"156"	"awhile, but soon I began to long for a tin plate, and some bacon and"
"157"	"beans.  I had camped out many and many a time before, and knew just what"
"158"	"was coming.  I went off, without waiting for serving men, and unsaddled"
"159"	"my horse, and washed such portions of his ribs and his spine as projected"
"160"	"through his hide, and when I came back, behold five stately circus tents"
"161"	"were up--tents that were brilliant, within, with blue, and gold, and"
"162"	"crimson, and all manner of splendid adornment!  I was speechless.  Then"
"163"	"they brought eight little iron bedsteads, and set them up in the tents;"
"164"	"they put a soft mattress and pillows and good blankets and two snow-white"
"165"	"sheets on each bed.  Next, they rigged a table about the centre-pole, and"
"166"	"on it placed pewter pitchers, basins, soap, and the whitest of towels"
"167"	"--one set for each man; they pointed to pockets in the tent, and said we"
"168"	"could put our small trifles in them for convenience, and if we needed"
"169"	"pins or such things, they were sticking every where.  Then came the"
"170"	"finishing touch--they spread carpets on the floor!  I simply said, “If"
"171"	"you call this camping out, all right--but it isn’t the style I am used"
"172"	"to; my little baggage that I brought along is at a discount.”"
"173"	"It grew dark, and they put candles on the tables--candles set in bright,"
"174"	"new, brazen candlesticks.  And soon the bell--a genuine, simon-pure bell"
"175"	"--rang, and we were invited to “the saloon.”  I had thought before that"
"176"	"we had a tent or so too many, but now here was one, at least, provided"
"177"	"for; it was to be used for nothing but an eating-saloon.  Like the"
"178"	"others, it was high enough for a family of giraffes to live in, and was"
"179"	"very handsome and clean and bright-colored within.  It was a gem of a"
"180"	"place.  A table for eight, and eight canvas chairs; a table-cloth and"
"181"	"napkins whose whiteness and whose fineness laughed to scorn the things we"
"182"	"were used to in the great excursion steamer; knives and forks,"
"183"	"soup-plates, dinner-plates--every thing, in the handsomest kind of"
"184"	"style.  It was wonderful!  And they call this camping out.  Those"
"185"	"stately fellows in baggy trowsers and turbaned fezzes brought in a"
"186"	"dinner which consisted of roast mutton, roast chicken, roast goose,"
"187"	"potatoes, bread, tea, pudding, apples, and delicious grapes; the viands"
"188"	"were better cooked than any we had eaten for weeks, and the table made a"
"189"	"finer appearance, with its large German silver candlesticks and other"
"190"	"finery, than any table we had sat down to for a good while, and yet that"
"191"	"polite dragoman, Abraham, came bowing in and apologizing for the whole"
"192"	"affair, on account of the unavoidable confusion of getting under way for"
"193"	"a very long trip, and promising to do a great deal better in future!"
"194"	"It is midnight, now, and we break camp at six in the morning."
"195"	"They call this camping out.  At this rate it is a glorious privilege to"
"196"	"be a pilgrim to the Holy Land."
"197"	"CHAPTER XLII."
