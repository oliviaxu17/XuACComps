"1"	"CHAPTER XVI."
"2"	"VERSAILLES!  It is wonderfully beautiful!  You gaze and stare and try to"
"3"	"understand that it is real, that it is on the earth, that it is not the"
"4"	"Garden of Eden--but your brain grows giddy, stupefied by the world of"
"5"	"beauty around you, and you half believe you are the dupe of an exquisite"
"6"	"dream.  The scene thrills one like military music!  A noble palace,"
"7"	"stretching its ornamented front, block upon block away, till it seemed"
"8"	"that it would never end; a grand promenade before it, whereon the armies"
"9"	"of an empire might parade; all about it rainbows of flowers, and colossal"
"10"	"statues that were almost numberless and yet seemed only scattered over"
"11"	"the ample space; broad flights of stone steps leading down from the"
"12"	"promenade to lower grounds of the park--stairways that whole regiments"
"13"	"might stand to arms upon and have room to spare; vast fountains whose"
"14"	"great bronze effigies discharged rivers of sparkling water into the air"
"15"	"and mingled a hundred curving jets together in forms of matchless beauty;"
"16"	"wide grass-carpeted avenues that branched hither and thither in every"
"17"	"direction and wandered to seemingly interminable distances, walled all"
"18"	"the way on either side with compact ranks of leafy trees whose branches"
"19"	"met above and formed arches as faultless and as symmetrical as ever were"
"20"	"carved in stone; and here and there were glimpses of sylvan lakes with"
"21"	"miniature ships glassed in their surfaces.  And every where--on the"
"22"	"palace steps, and the great promenade, around the fountains, among the"
"23"	"trees, and far under the arches of the endless avenues--hundreds and"
"24"	"hundreds of people in gay costumes walked or ran or danced, and gave to"
"25"	"the fairy picture the life and animation which was all of perfection it"
"26"	"could have lacked."
"27"	"It was worth a pilgrimage to see.  Everything is on so gigantic a scale."
"28"	"Nothing is small--nothing is cheap.  The statues are all large; the"
"29"	"palace is grand; the park covers a fair-sized county; the avenues are"
"30"	"interminable.  All the distances and all the dimensions about Versailles"
"31"	"are vast.  I used to think the pictures exaggerated these distances and"
"32"	"these dimensions beyond all reason, and that they made Versailles more"
"33"	"beautiful than it was possible for any place in the world to be.  I know"
"34"	"now that the pictures never came up to the subject in any respect, and"
"35"	"that no painter could represent Versailles on canvas as beautiful as it"
"36"	"is in reality.  I used to abuse Louis XIV for spending two hundred"
"37"	"millions of dollars in creating this marvelous park, when bread was so"
"38"	"scarce with some of his subjects; but I have forgiven him now.  He took a"
"39"	"tract of land sixty miles in circumference and set to work to make this"
"40"	"park and build this palace and a road to it from Paris.  He kept 36,000"
"41"	"men employed daily on it, and the labor was so unhealthy that they used"
"42"	"to die and be hauled off by cartloads every night.  The wife of a"
"43"	"nobleman of the time speaks of this as an “inconvenience,” but naively"
"44"	"remarks that “it does not seem worthy of attention in the happy state of"
"45"	"tranquillity we now enjoy.”"
"46"	"I always thought ill of people at home who trimmed their shrubbery into"
"47"	"pyramids and squares and spires and all manner of unnatural shapes, and"
"48"	"when I saw the same thing being practiced in this great park I began to"
"49"	"feel dissatisfied.  But I soon saw the idea of the thing and the wisdom"
"50"	"of it.  They seek the general effect.  We distort a dozen sickly trees"
"51"	"into unaccustomed shapes in a little yard no bigger than a dining room,"
"52"	"and then surely they look absurd enough.  But here they take two hundred"
"53"	"thousand tall forest trees and set them in a double row; allow no sign of"
"54"	"leaf or branch to grow on the trunk lower down than six feet above the"
"55"	"ground; from that point the boughs begin to project, and very gradually"
"56"	"they extend outward further and further till they meet overhead, and a"
"57"	"faultless tunnel of foliage is formed.  The arch is mathematically"
"58"	"precise.  The effect is then very fine.  They make trees take fifty"
"59"	"different shapes, and so these quaint effects are infinitely varied and"
"60"	"picturesque.  The trees in no two avenues are shaped alike, and"
"61"	"consequently the eye is not fatigued with anything in the nature of"
"62"	"monotonous uniformity.  I will drop this subject now, leaving it to"
"63"	"others to determine how these people manage to make endless ranks of"
"64"	"lofty forest trees grow to just a certain thickness of trunk (say a foot"
"65"	"and two-thirds); how they make them spring to precisely the same height"
"66"	"for miles; how they make them grow so close together; how they compel one"
"67"	"huge limb to spring from the same identical spot on each tree and form"
"68"	"the main sweep of the arch; and how all these things are kept exactly in"
"69"	"the same condition and in the same exquisite shapeliness and symmetry"
"70"	"month after month and year after year--for I have tried to reason out the"
"71"	"problem and have failed."
"72"	"We walked through the great hall of sculpture and the one hundred and"
"73"	"fifty galleries of paintings in the palace of Versailles, and felt that"
"74"	"to be in such a place was useless unless one had a whole year at his"
"75"	"disposal.  These pictures are all battle scenes, and only one solitary"
"76"	"little canvas among them all treats of anything but great French"
"77"	"victories.  We wandered, also, through the Grand Trianon and the Petit"
"78"	"Trianon, those monuments of royal prodigality, and with histories so"
"79"	"mournful--filled, as it is, with souvenirs of Napoleon the First, and"
"80"	"three dead kings and as many queens.  In one sumptuous bed they had all"
"81"	"slept in succession, but no one occupies it now.  In a large dining room"
"82"	"stood the table at which Louis XIV and his mistress Madame Maintenon, and"
"83"	"after them Louis XV, and Pompadour, had sat at their meals naked and"
"84"	"unattended--for the table stood upon a trapdoor, which descended with it"
"85"	"to regions below when it was necessary to replenish its dishes.  In a"
"86"	"room of the Petit Trianon stood the furniture, just as poor Marie"
"87"	"Antoinette left it when the mob came and dragged her and the King to"
"88"	"Paris, never to return.  Near at hand, in the stables, were prodigious"
"89"	"carriages that showed no color but gold--carriages used by former kings"
"90"	"of France on state occasions, and never used now save when a kingly head"
"91"	"is to be crowned or an imperial infant christened.  And with them were"
"92"	"some curious sleighs, whose bodies were shaped like lions, swans, tigers,"
"93"	"etc.--vehicles that had once been handsome with pictured designs and"
"94"	"fine workmanship, but were dusty and decaying now.  They had their"
"95"	"history.  When Louis XIV had finished the Grand Trianon, he told"
"96"	"Maintenon he had created a Paradise for her, and asked if she could think"
"97"	"of anything now to wish for.  He said he wished the Trianon to be"
"98"	"perfection--nothing less.  She said she could think of but one thing--it"
"99"	"was summer, and it was balmy France--yet she would like well to sleigh"
"100"	"ride in the leafy avenues of Versailles!  The next morning found miles"
"101"	"and miles of grassy avenues spread thick with snowy salt and sugar, and a"
"102"	"procession of those quaint sleighs waiting to receive the chief concubine"
"103"	"of the gaiest and most unprincipled court that France has ever seen!"
"104"	"From sumptuous Versailles, with its palaces, its statues, its gardens,"
"105"	"and its fountains, we journeyed back to Paris and sought its antipodes"
"106"	"--the Faubourg St. Antoine.  Little, narrow streets; dirty children"
"107"	"blockading them; greasy, slovenly women capturing and spanking them;"
"108"	"filthy dens on first floors, with rag stores in them (the heaviest"
"109"	"business in the Faubourg is the chiffonier’s); other filthy dens where"
"110"	"whole suits of second and third-hand clothing are sold at prices that"
"111"	"would ruin any proprietor who did not steal his stock; still other filthy"
"112"	"dens where they sold groceries--sold them by the half-pennyworth--five"
"113"	"dollars would buy the man out, goodwill and all.  Up these little crooked"
"114"	"streets they will murder a man for seven dollars and dump the body in the"
"115"	"Seine.  And up some other of these streets--most of them, I should say"
"116"	"--live lorettes."
"117"	"All through this Faubourg St. Antoine, misery, poverty, vice, and crime"
"118"	"go hand in hand, and the evidences of it stare one in the face from every"
"119"	"side.  Here the people live who begin the revolutions.  Whenever there is"
"120"	"anything of that kind to be done, they are always ready.  They take as"
"121"	"much genuine pleasure in building a barricade as they do in cutting a"
"122"	"throat or shoving a friend into the Seine.  It is these savage-looking"
"123"	"ruffians who storm the splendid halls of the Tuileries occasionally, and"
"124"	"swarm into Versailles when a king is to be called to account."
"125"	"But they will build no more barricades, they will break no more soldiers’"
"126"	"heads with paving-stones.  Louis Napoleon has taken care of all that.  He"
"127"	"is annihilating the crooked streets and building in their stead noble"
"128"	"boulevards as straight as an arrow--avenues which a cannon ball could"
"129"	"traverse from end to end without meeting an obstruction more irresistible"
"130"	"than the flesh and bones of men--boulevards whose stately edifices will"
"131"	"never afford refuges and plotting places for starving, discontented"
"132"	"revolution breeders.  Five of these great thoroughfares radiate from one"
"133"	"ample centre--a centre which is exceedingly well adapted to the"
"134"	"accommodation of heavy artillery.  The mobs used to riot there, but they"
"135"	"must seek another rallying-place in future.  And this ingenious Napoleon"
"136"	"paves the streets of his great cities with a smooth, compact composition"
"137"	"of asphaltum and sand.  No more barricades of flagstones--no more"
"138"	"assaulting his Majesty’s troops with cobbles.  I cannot feel friendly"
"139"	"toward my quondam fellow-American, Napoleon III., especially at this"
"140"	"time,--[July, 1867.]--when in fancy I see his credulous victim,"
"141"	"Maximilian, lying stark and stiff in Mexico, and his maniac widow"
"142"	"watching eagerly from her French asylum for the form that will never"
"143"	"come--but I do admire his nerve, his calm self-reliance, his shrewd good"
"144"	"sense."
