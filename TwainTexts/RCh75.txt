"2"	"The next night was appointed for a visit to the bottom of the crater, for"
"3"	"we desired to traverse its floor and see the “North Lake” (of fire) which"
"4"	"lay two miles away, toward the further wall.  After dark half a dozen of"
"5"	"us set out, with lanterns and native guides, and climbed down a crazy,"
"6"	"thousand-foot pathway in a crevice fractured in the crater wall, and"
"7"	"reached the bottom in safety."
"8"	"The irruption of the previous evening had spent its force and the floor"
"9"	"looked black and cold; but when we ran out upon it we found it hot yet,"
"10"	"to the feet, and it was likewise riven with crevices which revealed the"
"11"	"underlying fires gleaming vindictively.  A neighboring cauldron was"
"12"	"threatening to overflow, and this added to the dubiousness of the"
"13"	"situation.  So the native guides refused to continue the venture, and"
"14"	"then every body deserted except a stranger named Marlette.  He said he"
"15"	"had been in the crater a dozen times in daylight and believed he could"
"16"	"find his way through it at night.  He thought that a run of three hundred"
"17"	"yards would carry us over the hottest part of the floor and leave us our"
"18"	"shoe-soles.  His pluck gave me back-bone.  We took one lantern and"
"19"	"instructed the guides to hang the other to the roof of the look-out house"
"20"	"to serve as a beacon for us in case we got lost, and then the party"
"21"	"started back up the precipice and Marlette and I made our run."
"22"	"We skipped over the hot floor and over the red crevices with brisk"
"23"	"dispatch and reached the cold lava safe but with pretty warm feet.  Then"
"24"	"we took things leisurely and comfortably, jumping tolerably wide and"
"25"	"probably bottomless chasms, and threading our way through picturesque"
"26"	"lava upheavals with considerable confidence.  When we got fairly away"
"27"	"from the cauldrons of boiling fire, we seemed to be in a gloomy desert,"
"28"	"and a suffocatingly dark one, surrounded by dim walls that seemed to"
"29"	"tower to the sky.  The only cheerful objects were the glinting stars high"
"30"	"overhead."
"31"	"By and by Marlette shouted “Stop!” I never stopped quicker in my life."
"32"	"I asked what the matter was.  He said we were out of the path.  He said"
"33"	"we must not try to go on till we found it again, for we were surrounded"
"34"	"with beds of rotten lava through which we could easily break and plunge"
"35"	"down a thousand feet.  I thought eight hundred would answer for me, and"
"36"	"was about to say so when Marlette partly proved his statement by"
"37"	"accidentally crushing through and disappearing to his arm-pits."
"38"	"He got out and we hunted for the path with the lantern.  He said there"
"39"	"was only one path and that it was but vaguely defined.  We could not find"
"40"	"it.  The lava surface was all alike in the lantern light.  But he was an"
"41"	"ingenious man.  He said it was not the lantern that had informed him that"
"42"	"we were out of the path, but his feet.  He had noticed a crisp grinding"
"43"	"of fine lava-needles under his feet, and some instinct reminded him that"
"44"	"in the path these were all worn away.  So he put the lantern behind him,"
"45"	"and began to search with his boots instead of his eyes.  It was good"
"46"	"sagacity.  The first time his foot touched a surface that did not grind"
"47"	"under it he announced that the trail was found again; and after that we"
"48"	"kept up a sharp listening for the rasping sound and it always warned us"
"49"	"in time."
"50"	"It was a long tramp, but an exciting one.  We reached the North Lake"
"51"	"between ten and eleven o’clock, and sat down on a huge overhanging"
"52"	"lava-shelf, tired but satisfied.  The spectacle presented was worth"
"53"	"coming double the distance to see.  Under us, and stretching away before"
"54"	"us, was a heaving sea of molten fire of seemingly limitless extent.  The"
"55"	"glare from it was so blinding that it was some time before we could bear"
"56"	"to look upon it steadily."
"57"	"It was like gazing at the sun at noon-day, except that the glare was not"
"58"	"quite so white.  At unequal distances all around the shores of the lake"
"59"	"were nearly white-hot chimneys or hollow drums of lava, four or five feet"
"60"	"high, and up through them were bursting gorgeous sprays of lava-gouts and"
"61"	"gem spangles, some white, some red and some golden--a ceaseless"
"62"	"bombardment, and one that fascinated the eye with its unapproachable"
"63"	"splendor.  The mere distant jets, sparkling up through an intervening"
"64"	"gossamer veil of vapor, seemed miles away; and the further the curving"
"65"	"ranks of fiery fountains receded, the more fairy-like and beautiful they"
"66"	"appeared."
"67"	"Now and then the surging bosom of the lake under our noses would calm"
"68"	"down ominously and seem to be gathering strength for an enterprise; and"
"69"	"then all of a sudden a red dome of lava of the bulk of an ordinary"
"70"	"dwelling would heave itself aloft like an escaping balloon, then burst"
"71"	"asunder, and out of its heart would flit a pale-green film of vapor, and"
"72"	"float upward and vanish in the darkness--a released soul soaring homeward"
"73"	"from captivity with the damned, no doubt.  The crashing plunge of the"
"74"	"ruined dome into the lake again would send a world of seething billows"
"75"	"lashing against the shores and shaking the foundations of our perch.  By"
"76"	"and by, a loosened mass of the hanging shelf we sat on tumbled into the"
"77"	"lake, jarring the surroundings like an earthquake and delivering a"
"78"	"suggestion that may have been intended for a hint, and may not.  We did"
"79"	"not wait to see."
"80"	"We got lost again on our way back, and were more than an hour hunting for"
"81"	"the path.  We were where we could see the beacon lantern at the look-out"
"82"	"house at the time, but thought it was a star and paid no attention to it."
"83"	"We reached the hotel at two o’clock in the morning pretty well fagged"
"84"	"out."
"85"	"Kilauea never overflows its vast crater, but bursts a passage for its"
"86"	"lava through the mountain side when relief is necessary, and then the"
"87"	"destruction is fearful.  About 1840 it rent its overburdened stomach and"
"88"	"sent a broad river of fire careering down to the sea, which swept away"
"89"	"forests, huts, plantations and every thing else that lay in its path."
"90"	"The stream was five miles broad, in places, and two hundred feet deep,"
"91"	"and the distance it traveled was forty miles.  It tore up and bore away"
"92"	"acre-patches of land on its bosom like rafts--rocks, trees and all"
"93"	"intact.  At night the red glare was visible a hundred miles at sea; and"
"94"	"at a distance of forty miles fine print could be read at midnight.  The"
"95"	"atmosphere was poisoned with sulphurous vapors and choked with falling"
"96"	"ashes, pumice stones and cinders; countless columns of smoke rose up and"
"97"	"blended together in a tumbled canopy that hid the heavens and glowed with"
"98"	"a ruddy flush reflected from the fires below; here and there jets of lava"
"99"	"sprung hundreds of feet into the air and burst into rocket-sprays that"
"100"	"returned to earth in a crimson rain; and all the while the laboring"
"101"	"mountain shook with Nature’s great palsy and voiced its distress in"
"102"	"moanings and the muffled booming of subterranean thunders."
"103"	"Fishes were killed for twenty miles along the shore, where the lava"
"104"	"entered the sea.  The earthquakes caused some loss of human life, and a"
"105"	"prodigious tidal wave swept inland, carrying every thing before it and"
"106"	"drowning a number of natives.  The devastation consummated along the"
"107"	"route traversed by the river of lava was complete and incalculable.  Only"
"108"	"a Pompeii and a Herculaneum were needed at the foot of Kilauea to make"
"109"	"the story of the irruption immortal."
