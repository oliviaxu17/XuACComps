"1"	"CHAPTER XXXV."
"2"	"We left a dozen passengers in Constantinople, and sailed through the"
"3"	"beautiful Bosporus and far up into the Black Sea.  We left them in the"
"4"	"clutches of the celebrated Turkish guide, “FAR-AWAY MOSES,” who will"
"5"	"seduce them into buying a ship-load of ottar of roses, splendid Turkish"
"6"	"vestments, and all manner of curious things they can never have any use"
"7"	"for.  Murray’s invaluable guide-books have mentioned ‘Far-away Moses’"
"8"	"name, and he is a made man.  He rejoices daily in the fact that he is a"
"9"	"recognized celebrity.  However, we can not alter our established customs"
"10"	"to please the whims of guides; we can not show partialities this late in"
"11"	"the day.  Therefore, ignoring this fellow’s brilliant fame, and ignoring"
"12"	"the fanciful name he takes such pride in, we called him Ferguson, just as"
"13"	"we had done with all other guides.  It has kept him in a state of"
"14"	"smothered exasperation all the time.  Yet we meant him no harm.  After he"
"15"	"has gotten himself up regardless of expense, in showy, baggy trowsers,"
"16"	"yellow, pointed slippers, fiery fez, silken jacket of blue, voluminous"
"17"	"waist-sash of fancy Persian stuff filled with a battery of silver-mounted"
"18"	"horse-pistols, and has strapped on his terrible scimitar, he considers it"
"19"	"an unspeakable humiliation to be called Ferguson.  It can not be helped."
"20"	"All guides are Fergusons to us.  We can not master their dreadful foreign"
"21"	"names."
"22"	"Sebastopol is probably the worst battered town in Russia or any where"
"23"	"else.  But we ought to be pleased with it, nevertheless, for we have been"
"24"	"in no country yet where we have been so kindly received, and where we"
"25"	"felt that to be Americans was a sufficient visa for our passports.  The"
"26"	"moment the anchor was down, the Governor of the town immediately"
"27"	"dispatched an officer on board to inquire if he could be of any"
"28"	"assistance to us, and to invite us to make ourselves at home in"
"29"	"Sebastopol!  If you know Russia, you know that this was a wild stretch of"
"30"	"hospitality.  They are usually so suspicious of strangers that they worry"
"31"	"them excessively with the delays and aggravations incident to a"
"32"	"complicated passport system.  Had we come from any other country we could"
"33"	"not have had permission to enter Sebastopol and leave again under three"
"34"	"days--but as it was, we were at liberty to go and come when and where we"
"35"	"pleased.  Every body in Constantinople warned us to be very careful about"
"36"	"our passports, see that they were strictly ‘en regle’, and never to"
"37"	"mislay them for a moment: and they told us of numerous instances of"
"38"	"Englishmen and others who were delayed days, weeks, and even months, in"
"39"	"Sebastopol, on account of trifling informalities in their passports, and"
"40"	"for which they were not to blame.  I had lost my passport, and was"
"41"	"traveling under my room-mate’s, who stayed behind in Constantinople to"
"42"	"await our return.  To read the description of him in that passport and"
"43"	"then look at me, any man could see that I was no more like him than I am"
"44"	"like Hercules.  So I went into the harbor of Sebastopol with fear and"
"45"	"trembling--full of a vague, horrible apprehension that I was going to be"
"46"	"found out and hanged.  But all that time my true passport had been"
"47"	"floating gallantly overhead--and behold it was only our flag.  They never"
"48"	"asked us for any other."
"49"	"We have had a great many Russian and English gentlemen and ladies on"
"50"	"board to-day, and the time has passed cheerfully away.  They were all"
"51"	"happy-spirited people, and I never heard our mother tongue sound so"
"52"	"pleasantly as it did when it fell from those English lips in this far-off"
"53"	"land.  I talked to the Russians a good deal, just to be friendly, and"
"54"	"they talked to me from the same motive; I am sure that both enjoyed the"
"55"	"conversation, but never a word of it either of us understood.  I did most"
"56"	"of my talking to those English people though, and I am sorry we can not"
"57"	"carry some of them along with us."
"58"	"We have gone whithersoever we chose, to-day, and have met with nothing"
"59"	"but the kindest attentions.  Nobody inquired whether we had any passports"
"60"	"or not."
"61"	"Several of the officers of the Government have suggested that we take the"
"62"	"ship to a little watering-place thirty miles from here, and pay the"
"63"	"Emperor of Russia a visit.  He is rusticating there.  These officers said"
"64"	"they would take it upon themselves to insure us a cordial reception."
"65"	"They said if we would go, they would not only telegraph the Emperor, but"
"66"	"send a special courier overland to announce our coming.  Our time is so"
"67"	"short, though, and more especially our coal is so nearly out, that we"
"68"	"judged it best to forego the rare pleasure of holding social intercourse"
"69"	"with an Emperor."
"70"	"Ruined Pompeii is in good condition compared to Sebastopol.  Here, you"
"71"	"may look in whatsoever direction you please, and your eye encounters"
"72"	"scarcely any thing but ruin, ruin, ruin!--fragments of houses, crumbled"
"73"	"walls, torn and ragged hills, devastation every where!  It is as if a"
"74"	"mighty earthquake had spent all its terrible forces upon this one little"
"75"	"spot.  For eighteen long months the storms of war beat upon the helpless"
"76"	"town, and left it at last the saddest wreck that ever the sun has looked"
"77"	"upon.  Not one solitary house escaped unscathed--not one remained"
"78"	"habitable, even.  Such utter and complete ruin one could hardly conceive"
"79"	"of.  The houses had all been solid, dressed stone structures; most of"
"80"	"them were ploughed through and through by cannon balls--unroofed and"
"81"	"sliced down from eaves to foundation--and now a row of them, half a mile"
"82"	"long, looks merely like an endless procession of battered chimneys.  No"
"83"	"semblance of a house remains in such as these.  Some of the larger"
"84"	"buildings had corners knocked off; pillars cut in two; cornices smashed;"
"85"	"holes driven straight through the walls.  Many of these holes are as"
"86"	"round and as cleanly cut as if they had been made with an auger.  Others"
"87"	"are half pierced through, and the clean impression is there in the rock,"
"88"	"as smooth and as shapely as if it were done in putty.  Here and there a"
"89"	"ball still sticks in a wall, and from it iron tears trickle down and"
"90"	"discolor the stone."
"91"	"The battle-fields were pretty close together.  The Malakoff tower is on"
"92"	"a hill which is right in the edge of the town.  The Redan was within"
"93"	"rifle-shot of the Malakoff; Inkerman was a mile away; and Balaklava"
"94"	"removed but an hour’s ride.  The French trenches, by which they"
"95"	"approached and invested the Malakoff were carried so close under its"
"96"	"sloping sides that one might have stood by the Russian guns and tossed a"
"97"	"stone into them. Repeatedly, during three terrible days, they swarmed up"
"98"	"the little Malakoff hill, and were beaten back with terrible slaughter."
"99"	"Finally, they captured the place, and drove the Russians out, who then"
"100"	"tried to retreat into the town, but the English had taken the Redan, and"
"101"	"shut them off with a wall of flame; there was nothing for them to do but"
"102"	"go back and retake the Malakoff or die under its guns.  They did go"
"103"	"back; they took the Malakoff and retook it two or three times, but their"
"104"	"desperate valor could not avail, and they had to give up at last."
"105"	"These fearful fields, where such tempests of death used to rage, are"
"106"	"peaceful enough now; no sound is heard, hardly a living thing moves about"
"107"	"them, they are lonely and silent--their desolation is complete."
"108"	"There was nothing else to do, and so every body went to hunting relics."
"109"	"They have stocked the ship with them.  They brought them from the"
"110"	"Malakoff, from the Redan, Inkerman, Balaklava--every where.  They have"
"111"	"brought cannon balls, broken ramrods, fragments of shell--iron enough to"
"112"	"freight a sloop.  Some have even brought bones--brought them laboriously"
"113"	"from great distances, and were grieved to hear the surgeon pronounce them"
"114"	"only bones of mules and oxen.  I knew Blucher would not lose an"
"115"	"opportunity like this.  He brought a sack full on board and was going for"
"116"	"another.  I prevailed upon him not to go.  He has already turned his"
"117"	"state-room into a museum of worthless trumpery, which he has gathered up"
"118"	"in his travels.  He is labeling his trophies, now.  I picked up one a"
"119"	"while ago, and found it marked “Fragment of a Russian General.”  I"
"120"	"carried it out to get a better light upon it--it was nothing but a couple"
"121"	"of teeth and part of the jaw-bone of a horse.  I said with some asperity:"
"122"	"“Fragment of a Russian General!  This is absurd.  Are you never going to"
"123"	"learn any sense?”"
"124"	"He only said: “Go slow--the old woman won’t know any different.”  [His"
"125"	"aunt.]"
"126"	"This person gathers mementoes with a perfect recklessness, now-a-days;"
"127"	"mixes them all up together, and then serenely labels them without any"
"128"	"regard to truth, propriety, or even plausibility.  I have found him"
"129"	"breaking a stone in two, and labeling half of it “Chunk busted from the"
"130"	"pulpit of Demosthenes,” and the other half “Darnick from the Tomb of"
"131"	"Abelard and Heloise.”  I have known him to gather up a handful of pebbles"
"132"	"by the roadside, and bring them on board ship and label them as coming"
"133"	"from twenty celebrated localities five hundred miles apart.  I"
"134"	"remonstrate against these outrages upon reason and truth, of course, but"
"135"	"it does no good.  I get the same tranquil, unanswerable reply every time:"
"136"	"“It don’t signify--the old woman won’t know any different.”"
"137"	"Ever since we three or four fortunate ones made the midnight trip to"
"138"	"Athens, it has afforded him genuine satisfaction to give every body in"
"139"	"the ship a pebble from the Mars-hill where St. Paul preached.  He got all"
"140"	"those pebbles on the sea shore, abreast the ship, but professes to have"
"141"	"gathered them from one of our party.  However, it is not of any use for"
"142"	"me to expose the deception--it affords him pleasure, and does no harm to"
"143"	"any body.  He says he never expects to run out of mementoes of St. Paul"
"144"	"as long as he is in reach of a sand-bank.  Well, he is no worse than"
"145"	"others.  I notice that all travelers supply deficiencies in their"
"146"	"collections in the same way.  I shall never have any confidence in such"
"147"	"things again while I live."
