"1"	"CHAPTER XX."
"2"	"We left Milan by rail.  The Cathedral six or seven miles behind us; vast,"
"3"	"dreamy, bluish, snow-clad mountains twenty miles in front of us,--these"
"4"	"were the accented points in the scenery.  The more immediate scenery"
"5"	"consisted of fields and farm-houses outside the car and a monster-headed"
"6"	"dwarf and a moustached woman inside it.  These latter were not"
"7"	"show-people.  Alas, deformity and female beards are too common in Italy"
"8"	"to attract attention."
"9"	"We passed through a range of wild, picturesque hills, steep, wooded,"
"10"	"cone-shaped, with rugged crags projecting here and there, and with"
"11"	"dwellings and ruinous castles perched away up toward the drifting clouds."
"12"	"We lunched at the curious old town of Como, at the foot of the lake, and"
"13"	"then took the small steamer and had an afternoon’s pleasure excursion to"
"14"	"this place,--Bellaggio."
"15"	"When we walked ashore, a party of policemen (people whose cocked hats and"
"16"	"showy uniforms would shame the finest uniform in the military service of"
"17"	"the United States,) put us into a little stone cell and locked us in.  We"
"18"	"had the whole passenger list for company, but their room would have been"
"19"	"preferable, for there was no light, there were no windows, no"
"20"	"ventilation.  It was close and hot.  We were much crowded.  It was the"
"21"	"Black Hole of Calcutta on a small scale.  Presently a smoke rose about"
"22"	"our feet--a smoke that smelled of all the dead things of earth, of all"
"23"	"the putrefaction and corruption imaginable."
"24"	"We were there five minutes, and when we got out it was hard to tell which"
"25"	"of us carried the vilest fragrance."
"26"	"These miserable outcasts called that “fumigating” us, and the term was a"
"27"	"tame one indeed.  They fumigated us to guard themselves against the"
"28"	"cholera, though we hailed from no infected port.  We had left the cholera"
"29"	"far behind us all the time.  However, they must keep epidemics away"
"30"	"somehow or other, and fumigation is cheaper than soap.  They must either"
"31"	"wash themselves or fumigate other people.  Some of the lower classes had"
"32"	"rather die than wash, but the fumigation of strangers causes them no"
"33"	"pangs.  They need no fumigation themselves.  Their habits make it"
"34"	"unnecessary.  They carry their preventive with them; they sweat and"
"35"	"fumigate all the day long.  I trust I am a humble and a consistent"
"36"	"Christian.  I try to do what is right.  I know it is my duty to “pray for"
"37"	"them that despitefully use me;” and therefore, hard as it is, I shall"
"38"	"still try to pray for these fumigating, maccaroni-stuffing"
"39"	"organ-grinders."
"40"	"Our hotel sits at the water’s edge--at least its front garden does--and"
"41"	"we walk among the shrubbery and smoke at twilight; we look afar off at"
"42"	"Switzerland and the Alps, and feel an indolent willingness to look no"
"43"	"closer; we go down the steps and swim in the lake; we take a shapely"
"44"	"little boat and sail abroad among the reflections of the stars; lie on"
"45"	"the thwarts and listen to the distant laughter, the singing, the soft"
"46"	"melody of flutes and guitars that comes floating across the water from"
"47"	"pleasuring gondolas; we close the evening with exasperating billiards on"
"48"	"one of those same old execrable tables.  A midnight luncheon in our ample"
"49"	"bed-chamber; a final smoke in its contracted veranda facing the water,"
"50"	"the gardens, and the mountains; a summing up of the day’s events.  Then"
"51"	"to bed, with drowsy brains harassed with a mad panorama that mixes up"
"52"	"pictures of France, of Italy, of the ship, of the ocean, of home, in"
"53"	"grotesque and bewildering disorder.  Then a melting away of familiar"
"54"	"faces, of cities, and of tossing waves, into a great calm of"
"55"	"forgetfulness and peace."
"56"	"After which, the nightmare."
"57"	"Breakfast in the morning, and then the lake."
"58"	"I did not like it yesterday.  I thought Lake Tahoe was much finer."
"59"	"I have to confess now, however, that my judgment erred somewhat, though"
"60"	"not extravagantly.  I always had an idea that Como was a vast basin of"
"61"	"water, like Tahoe, shut in by great mountains.  Well, the border of huge"
"62"	"mountains is here, but the lake itself is not a basin.  It is as crooked"
"63"	"as any brook, and only from one-quarter to two-thirds as wide as the"
"64"	"Mississippi.  There is not a yard of low ground on either side of it"
"65"	"--nothing but endless chains of mountains that spring abruptly from the"
"66"	"water’s edge and tower to altitudes varying from a thousand to two"
"67"	"thousand feet.  Their craggy sides are clothed with vegetation, and white"
"68"	"specks of houses peep out from the luxuriant foliage everywhere; they are"
"69"	"even perched upon jutting and picturesque pinnacles a thousand feet above"
"70"	"your head."
"71"	"Again, for miles along the shores, handsome country seats, surrounded by"
"72"	"gardens and groves, sit fairly in the water, sometimes in nooks carved by"
"73"	"Nature out of the vine-hung precipices, and with no ingress or egress"
"74"	"save by boats.  Some have great broad stone staircases leading down to"
"75"	"the water, with heavy stone balustrades ornamented with statuary and"
"76"	"fancifully adorned with creeping vines and bright-colored flowers--for"
"77"	"all the world like a drop curtain in a theatre, and lacking nothing but"
"78"	"long-waisted, high-heeled women and plumed gallants in silken tights"
"79"	"coming down to go serenading in the splendid gondola in waiting."
"80"	"A great feature of Como’s attractiveness is the multitude of pretty"
"81"	"houses and gardens that cluster upon its shores and on its mountain"
"82"	"sides.  They look so snug and so homelike, and at eventide when every"
"83"	"thing seems to slumber, and the music of the vesper bells comes stealing"
"84"	"over the water, one almost believes that nowhere else than on the lake of"
"85"	"Como can there be found such a paradise of tranquil repose."
"86"	"From my window here in Bellaggio, I have a view of the other side of the"
"87"	"lake now, which is as beautiful as a picture.  A scarred and wrinkled"
"88"	"precipice rises to a height of eighteen hundred feet; on a tiny bench"
"89"	"half way up its vast wall, sits a little snowflake of a church, no bigger"
"90"	"than a martin-box, apparently; skirting the base of the cliff are a"
"91"	"hundred orange groves and gardens, flecked with glimpses of the white"
"92"	"dwellings that are buried in them; in front, three or four gondolas lie"
"93"	"idle upon the water--and in the burnished mirror of the lake, mountain,"
"94"	"chapel, houses, groves and boats are counterfeited so brightly and so"
"95"	"clearly that one scarce knows where the reality leaves off and the"
"96"	"reflection begins!"
"97"	"The surroundings of this picture are fine.  A mile away, a grove-plumed"
"98"	"promontory juts far into the lake and glasses its palace in the blue"
"99"	"depths; in midstream a boat is cutting the shining surface and leaving a"
"100"	"long track behind, like a ray of light; the mountains beyond are veiled"
"101"	"in a dreamy purple haze; far in the opposite direction a tumbled mass of"
"102"	"domes and verdant slopes and valleys bars the lake, and here indeed does"
"103"	"distance lend enchantment to the view--for on this broad canvas, sun and"
"104"	"clouds and the richest of atmospheres have blended a thousand tints"
"105"	"together, and over its surface the filmy lights and shadows drift, hour"
"106"	"after hour, and glorify it with a beauty that seems reflected out of"
"107"	"Heaven itself.  Beyond all question, this is the most voluptuous scene we"
"108"	"have yet looked upon."
"109"	"Last night the scenery was striking and picturesque.  On the other side"
"110"	"crags and trees and snowy houses were reflected in the lake with a"
"111"	"wonderful distinctness, and streams of light from many a distant window"
"112"	"shot far abroad over the still waters.  On this side, near at hand, great"
"113"	"mansions, white with moonlight, glared out from the midst of masses of"
"114"	"foliage that lay black and shapeless in the shadows that fell from the"
"115"	"cliff above--and down in the margin of the lake every feature of the"
"116"	"weird vision was faithfully repeated."
"117"	"Today we have idled through a wonder of a garden attached to a ducal"
"118"	"estate--but enough of description is enough, I judge."
"119"	"I suspect that this was the same place the gardener’s son deceived the"
"120"	"Lady of Lyons with, but I do not know.  You may have heard of the passage"
"121"	"somewhere:"
"122"	"          “A deep vale,"
"123"	"          Shut out by Alpine hills from the rude world,"
"124"	"          Near a clear lake margined by fruits of gold"
"125"	"          And whispering myrtles:"
"126"	"          Glassing softest skies, cloudless,"
"127"	"          Save with rare and roseate shadows;"
"128"	"          A palace, lifting to eternal heaven its marbled walls,"
"129"	"          From out a glossy bower of coolest foliage musical with birds.”"
"130"	"That is all very well, except the “clear” part of the lake.  It certainly"
"131"	"is clearer than a great many lakes, but how dull its waters are compared"
"132"	"with the wonderful transparence of Lake Tahoe!  I speak of the north"
"133"	"shore of Tahoe, where one can count the scales on a trout at a depth of a"
"134"	"hundred and eighty feet.  I have tried to get this statement off at par"
"135"	"here, but with no success; so I have been obliged to negotiate it at"
"136"	"fifty percent discount.  At this rate I find some takers; perhaps the"
"137"	"reader will receive it on the same terms--ninety feet instead of one"
"138"	"hundred and eighty.  But let it be remembered that those are forced"
"139"	"terms--Sheriff’s sale prices.  As far as I am privately concerned, I"
"140"	"abate not a jot of the original assertion that in those strangely"
"141"	"magnifying waters one may count the scales on a trout (a trout of the"
"142"	"large kind,) at a depth of a hundred and eighty feet--may see every"
"143"	"pebble on the bottom--might even count a paper of dray-pins.  People talk"
"144"	"of the transparent waters of the Mexican Bay of Acapulco, but in my own"
"145"	"experience I know they cannot compare with those I am speaking of.  I"
"146"	"have fished for trout, in Tahoe, and at a measured depth of eighty-four"
"147"	"feet I have seen them put their noses to the bait and I could see their"
"148"	"gills open and shut.  I could hardly have seen the trout themselves at"
"149"	"that distance in the open air."
"150"	"As I go back in spirit and recall that noble sea, reposing among the"
"151"	"snow-peaks six thousand feet above the ocean, the conviction comes strong"
"152"	"upon me again that Como would only seem a bedizened little courtier in"
"153"	"that august presence."
"154"	"Sorrow and misfortune overtake the legislature that still from year to"
"155"	"year permits Tahoe to retain its unmusical cognomen!  Tahoe!  It suggests"
"156"	"no crystal waters, no picturesque shores, no sublimity.  Tahoe for a sea"
"157"	"in the clouds: a sea that has character and asserts it in solemn calms at"
"158"	"times, at times in savage storms; a sea whose royal seclusion is guarded"
"159"	"by a cordon of sentinel peaks that lift their frosty fronts nine thousand"
"160"	"feet above the level world; a sea whose every aspect is impressive, whose"
"161"	"belongings are all beautiful, whose lonely majesty types the Deity!"
"162"	"Tahoe means grasshoppers.  It means grasshopper soup.  It is Indian, and"
"163"	"suggestive of Indians.  They say it is Pi-ute--possibly it is Digger."
"164"	"I am satisfied it was named by the Diggers--those degraded savages who"
"165"	"roast their dead relatives, then mix the human grease and ashes of bones"
"166"	"with tar, and “gaum” it thick all over their heads and foreheads and"
"167"	"ears, and go caterwauling about the hills and call it mourning.  These"
"168"	"are the gentry that named the Lake."
"169"	"People say that Tahoe means “Silver Lake”--“Limpid Water”--“Falling"
"170"	"Leaf.”  Bosh.  It means grasshopper soup, the favorite dish of the Digger"
"171"	"tribe,--and of the Pi-utes as well.  It isn’t worth while, in these"
"172"	"practical times, for people to talk about Indian poetry--there never was"
"173"	"any in them--except in the Fenimore Cooper Indians.  But they are an"
"174"	"extinct tribe that never existed.  I know the Noble Red Man.  I have"
"175"	"camped with the Indians; I have been on the warpath with them, taken part"
"176"	"in the chase with them--for grasshoppers; helped them steal cattle; I"
"177"	"have roamed with them, scalped them, had them for breakfast.  I would"
"178"	"gladly eat the whole race if I had a chance."
"179"	"But I am growing unreliable.  I will return to my comparison of the"
"180"	"lakes.  Como is a little deeper than Tahoe, if people here tell the"
"181"	"truth.  They say it is eighteen hundred feet deep at this point, but it"
"182"	"does not look a dead enough blue for that.  Tahoe is one thousand five"
"183"	"hundred and twenty-five feet deep in the centre, by the state geologist’s"
"184"	"measurement.  They say the great peak opposite this town is five thousand"
"185"	"feet high: but I feel sure that three thousand feet of that statement is"
"186"	"a good honest lie.  The lake is a mile wide, here, and maintains about"
"187"	"that width from this point to its northern extremity--which is distant"
"188"	"sixteen miles: from here to its southern extremity--say fifteen miles--it"
"189"	"is not over half a mile wide in any place, I should think.  Its snow-clad"
"190"	"mountains one hears so much about are only seen occasionally, and then in"
"191"	"the distance, the Alps.  Tahoe is from ten to eighteen miles wide, and"
"192"	"its mountains shut it in like a wall.  Their summits are never free from"
"193"	"snow the year round.  One thing about it is very strange: it never has"
"194"	"even a skim of ice upon its surface, although lakes in the same range of"
"195"	"mountains, lying in a lower and warmer temperature, freeze over in"
"196"	"winter."
"197"	"It is cheerful to meet a shipmate in these out-of-the-way places and"
"198"	"compare notes with him.  We have found one of ours here--an old soldier"
"199"	"of the war, who is seeking bloodless adventures and rest from his"
"200"	"campaigns in these sunny lands.--[Colonel J.  HERON FOSTER, editor of a"
"201"	"Pittsburgh journal, and a most estimable gentleman.  As these sheets are"
"202"	"being prepared for the press I am pained to learn of his decease shortly"
"203"	"after his return home--M.T.]"
"204"	"CHAPTER XXI."
