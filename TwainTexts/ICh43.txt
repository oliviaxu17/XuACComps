"1"	"CHAPTER XLIII."
"2"	"We had a tedious ride of about five hours, in the sun, across the Valley"
"3"	"of Lebanon.  It proved to be not quite so much of a garden as it had"
"4"	"seemed from the hill-sides.  It was a desert, weed-grown waste, littered"
"5"	"thickly with stones the size of a man’s fist.  Here and there the natives"
"6"	"had scratched the ground and reared a sickly crop of grain, but for the"
"7"	"most part the valley was given up to a handful of shepherds, whose flocks"
"8"	"were doing what they honestly could to get a living, but the chances were"
"9"	"against them.  We saw rude piles of stones standing near the roadside, at"
"10"	"intervals, and recognized the custom of marking boundaries which obtained"
"11"	"in Jacob’s time.  There were no walls, no fences, no hedges--nothing to"
"12"	"secure a man’s possessions but these random heaps of stones.  The"
"13"	"Israelites held them sacred in the old patriarchal times, and these other"
"14"	"Arabs, their lineal descendants, do so likewise.  An American, of"
"15"	"ordinary intelligence, would soon widely extend his property, at an"
"16"	"outlay of mere manual labor, performed at night, under so loose a system"
"17"	"of fencing as this."
"18"	"The plows these people use are simply a sharpened stick, such as Abraham"
"19"	"plowed with, and they still winnow their wheat as he did--they pile it on"
"20"	"the house-top, and then toss it by shovel-fulls into the air until the"
"21"	"wind has blown all the chaff away.  They never invent any thing, never"
"22"	"learn any thing."
"23"	"We had a fine race, of a mile, with an Arab perched on a camel.  Some of"
"24"	"the horses were fast, and made very good time, but the camel scampered by"
"25"	"them without any very great effort.  The yelling and shouting, and"
"26"	"whipping and galloping, of all parties interested, made it an"
"27"	"exhilarating, exciting, and particularly boisterous race."
"28"	"At eleven o’clock, our eyes fell upon the walls and columns of Baalbec, a"
"29"	"noble ruin whose history is a sealed book.  It has stood there for"
"30"	"thousands of years, the wonder and admiration of travelers; but who built"
"31"	"it, or when it was built, are questions that may never be answered.  One"
"32"	"thing is very sure, though.  Such grandeur of design, and such grace of"
"33"	"execution, as one sees in the temples of Baalbec, have not been equaled"
"34"	"or even approached in any work of men’s hands that has been built within"
"35"	"twenty centuries past."
"36"	"The great Temple of the Sun, the Temple of Jupiter, and several smaller"
"37"	"temples, are clustered together in the midst of one of these miserable"
"38"	"Syrian villages, and look strangely enough in such plebeian company."
"39"	"These temples are built upon massive substructions that might support a"
"40"	"world, almost; the materials used are blocks of stone as large as an"
"41"	"omnibus--very few, if any of them, are smaller than a carpenter’s tool"
"42"	"chest--and these substructions are traversed by tunnels of masonry"
"43"	"through which a train of cars might pass.  With such foundations as"
"44"	"these, it is little wonder that Baalbec has lasted so long.  The Temple"
"45"	"of the Sun is nearly three hundred feet long and one hundred and sixty"
"46"	"feet wide.  It had fifty-four columns around it, but only six are"
"47"	"standing now--the others lie broken at its base, a confused and"
"48"	"picturesque heap.  The six columns are their bases, Corinthian capitals"
"49"	"and entablature--and six more shapely columns do not exist.  The columns"
"50"	"and the entablature together are ninety feet high--a prodigious altitude"
"51"	"for shafts of stone to reach, truly--and yet one only thinks of their"
"52"	"beauty and symmetry when looking at them; the pillars look slender and"
"53"	"delicate, the entablature, with its elaborate sculpture, looks like rich"
"54"	"stucco-work.  But when you have gazed aloft till your eyes are weary, you"
"55"	"glance at the great fragments of pillars among which you are standing,"
"56"	"and find that they are eight feet through; and with them lie beautiful"
"57"	"capitals apparently as large as a small cottage; and also single slabs of"
"58"	"stone, superbly sculptured, that are four or five feet thick, and would"
"59"	"completely cover the floor of any ordinary parlor.  You wonder where"
"60"	"these monstrous things came from, and it takes some little time to"
"61"	"satisfy yourself that the airy and graceful fabric that towers above your"
"62"	"head is made up of their mates.  It seems too preposterous."
"63"	"The Temple of Jupiter is a smaller ruin than the one I have been speaking"
"64"	"of, and yet is immense.  It is in a tolerable state of preservation.  One"
"65"	"row of nine columns stands almost uninjured.  They are sixty-five feet"
"66"	"high and support a sort of porch or roof, which connects them with the"
"67"	"roof of the building.  This porch-roof is composed of tremendous slabs of"
"68"	"stone, which are so finely sculptured on the under side that the work"
"69"	"looks like a fresco from below.  One or two of these slabs had fallen,"
"70"	"and again I wondered if the gigantic masses of carved stone that lay"
"71"	"about me were no larger than those above my head.  Within the temple, the"
"72"	"ornamentation was elaborate and colossal.  What a wonder of architectural"
"73"	"beauty and grandeur this edifice must have been when it was new!  And"
"74"	"what a noble picture it and its statelier companion, with the chaos of"
"75"	"mighty fragments scattered about them, yet makes in the moonlight!"
"76"	"I can not conceive how those immense blocks of stone were ever hauled"
"77"	"from the quarries, or how they were ever raised to the dizzy heights they"
"78"	"occupy in the temples.  And yet these sculptured blocks are trifles in"
"79"	"size compared with the rough-hewn blocks that form the wide verandah or"
"80"	"platform which surrounds the Great Temple.  One stretch of that platform,"
"81"	"two hundred feet long, is composed of blocks of stone as large, and some"
"82"	"of them larger, than a street-car.  They surmount a wall about ten or"
"83"	"twelve feet high.  I thought those were large rocks, but they sank into"
"84"	"insignificance compared with those which formed another section of the"
"85"	"platform.  These were three in number, and I thought that each of them"
"86"	"was about as long as three street cars placed end to end, though of"
"87"	"course they are a third wider and a third higher than a street car."
"88"	"Perhaps two railway freight cars of the largest pattern, placed end to"
"89"	"end, might better represent their size.  In combined length these three"
"90"	"stones stretch nearly two hundred feet; they are thirteen feet square;"
"91"	"two of them are sixty-four feet long each, and the third is sixty-nine."
"92"	"They are built into the massive wall some twenty feet above the ground."
"93"	"They are there, but how they got there is the question.  I have seen the"
"94"	"hull of a steamboat that was smaller than one of those stones.  All these"
"95"	"great walls are as exact and shapely as the flimsy things we build of"
"96"	"bricks in these days.  A race of gods or of giants must have inhabited"
"97"	"Baalbec many a century ago.  Men like the men of our day could hardly"
"98"	"rear such temples as these."
"99"	"We went to the quarry from whence the stones of Baalbec were taken.  It"
"100"	"was about a quarter of a mile off, and down hill.  In a great pit lay the"
"101"	"mate of the largest stone in the ruins.  It lay there just as the giants"
"102"	"of that old forgotten time had left it when they were called hence--just"
"103"	"as they had left it, to remain for thousands of years, an eloquent rebuke"
"104"	"unto such as are prone to think slightingly of the men who lived before"
"105"	"them.  This enormous block lies there, squared and ready for the"
"106"	"builders’ hands--a solid mass fourteen feet by seventeen, and but a few"
"107"	"inches less than seventy feet long!  Two buggies could be driven abreast"
"108"	"of each other, on its surface, from one end of it to the other, and leave"
"109"	"room enough for a man or two to walk on either side."
"110"	"One might swear that all the John Smiths and George Wilkinsons, and all"
"111"	"the other pitiful nobodies between Kingdom Come and Baalbec would"
"112"	"inscribe their poor little names upon the walls of Baalbec’s magnificent"
"113"	"ruins, and would add the town, the county and the State they came from"
"114"	"--and swearing thus, be infallibly correct.  It is a pity some great ruin"
"115"	"does not fall in and flatten out some of these reptiles, and scare their"
"116"	"kind out of ever giving their names to fame upon any walls or monuments"
"117"	"again, forever."
"118"	"Properly, with the sorry relics we bestrode, it was a three days’ journey"
"119"	"to Damascus.  It was necessary that we should do it in less than two."
"120"	"It was necessary because our three pilgrims would not travel on the"
"121"	"Sabbath day.  We were all perfectly willing to keep the Sabbath day, but"
"122"	"there are times when to keep the letter of a sacred law whose spirit is"
"123"	"righteous, becomes a sin, and this was a case in point.  We pleaded for"
"124"	"the tired, ill-treated horses, and tried to show that their faithful"
"125"	"service deserved kindness in return, and their hard lot compassion.  But"
"126"	"when did ever self-righteousness know the sentiment of pity?  What were a"
"127"	"few long hours added to the hardships of some over-taxed brutes when"
"128"	"weighed against the peril of those human souls?  It was not the most"
"129"	"promising party to travel with and hope to gain a higher veneration for"
"130"	"religion through the example of its devotees.  We said the Saviour who"
"131"	"pitied dumb beasts and taught that the ox must be rescued from the mire"
"132"	"even on the Sabbath day, would not have counseled a forced march like"
"133"	"this.  We said the “long trip” was exhausting and therefore dangerous in"
"134"	"the blistering heats of summer, even when the ordinary days’ stages were"
"135"	"traversed, and if we persisted in this hard march, some of us might be"
"136"	"stricken down with the fevers of the country in consequence of it."
"137"	"Nothing could move the pilgrims.  They must press on.  Men might die,"
"138"	"horses might die, but they must enter upon holy soil next week, with no"
"139"	"Sabbath-breaking stain upon them.  Thus they were willing to commit a sin"
"140"	"against the spirit of religious law, in order that they might preserve"
"141"	"the letter of it.  It was not worth while to tell them “the letter"
"142"	"kills.”  I am talking now about personal friends; men whom I like; men"
"143"	"who are good citizens; who are honorable, upright, conscientious; but"
"144"	"whose idea of the Saviour’s religion seems to me distorted.  They lecture"
"145"	"our shortcomings unsparingly, and every night they call us together and"
"146"	"read to us chapters from the Testament that are full of gentleness, of"
"147"	"charity, and of tender mercy; and then all the next day they stick to"
"148"	"their saddles clear up to the summits of these rugged mountains, and"
"149"	"clear down again.  Apply the Testament’s gentleness, and charity, and"
"150"	"tender mercy to a toiling, worn and weary horse?--Nonsense--these are for"
"151"	"God’s human creatures, not His dumb ones.  What the pilgrims choose to"
"152"	"do, respect for their almost sacred character demands that I should allow"
"153"	"to pass--but I would so like to catch any other member of the party"
"154"	"riding his horse up one of these exhausting hills once!"
"155"	"We have given the pilgrims a good many examples that might benefit them,"
"156"	"but it is virtue thrown away.  They have never heard a cross word out of"
"157"	"our lips toward each other--but they have quarreled once or twice.  We"
"158"	"love to hear them at it, after they have been lecturing us.  The very"
"159"	"first thing they did, coming ashore at Beirout, was to quarrel in the"
"160"	"boat.  I have said I like them, and I do like them--but every time they"
"161"	"read me a scorcher of a lecture I mean to talk back in print."
"162"	"Not content with doubling the legitimate stages, they switched off the"
"163"	"main road and went away out of the way to visit an absurd fountain called"
"164"	"Figia, because Baalam’s ass had drank there once.  So we journeyed on,"
"165"	"through the terrible hills and deserts and the roasting sun, and then far"
"166"	"into the night, seeking the honored pool of Baalam’s ass, the patron"
"167"	"saint of all pilgrims like us.  I find no entry but this in my note-book:"
"168"	"     “Rode to-day, altogether, thirteen hours, through deserts, partly,"
"169"	"     and partly over barren, unsightly hills, and latterly through wild,"
"170"	"     rocky scenery, and camped at about eleven o’clock at night on the"
"171"	"     banks of a limpid stream, near a Syrian village.  Do not know its"
"172"	"     name--do not wish to know it--want to go to bed.  Two horses lame"
"173"	"     (mine and Jack’s) and the others worn out.  Jack and I walked three"
"174"	"     or four miles, over the hills, and led the horses.  Fun--but of a"
"175"	"     mild type.”"
"176"	"Twelve or thirteen hours in the saddle, even in a Christian land and a"
"177"	"Christian climate, and on a good horse, is a tiresome journey; but in an"
"178"	"oven like Syria, in a ragged spoon of a saddle that slips fore-and-aft,"
"179"	"and “thort-ships,” and every way, and on a horse that is tired and lame,"
"180"	"and yet must be whipped and spurred with hardly a moment’s cessation all"
"181"	"day long, till the blood comes from his side, and your conscience hurts"
"182"	"you every time you strike if you are half a man,--it is a journey to be"
"183"	"remembered in bitterness of spirit and execrated with emphasis for a"
"184"	"liberal division of a man’s lifetime."
