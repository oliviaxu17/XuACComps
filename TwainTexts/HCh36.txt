"1"	"CHAPTER XXXVI."
"2"	"AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the"
"3"	"lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our"
"4"	"pile of fox-fire, and went to work.  We cleared everything out of the"
"5"	"way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.  Tom"
"6"	"said he was right behind Jim’s bed now, and we’d dig in under it, and"
"7"	"when we got through there couldn’t nobody in the cabin ever know there"
"8"	"was any hole there, because Jim’s counter-pin hung down most to the"
"9"	"ground, and you’d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole."
"10"	" So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then"
"11"	"we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn’t see"
"12"	"we’d done anything hardly.  At last I says:"
"13"	"“This ain’t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job,"
"14"	"Tom Sawyer.”"
"15"	"He never said nothing.  But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped"
"16"	"digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking."
"17"	"Then he says:"
"18"	"“It ain’t no use, Huck, it ain’t a-going to work.  If we was prisoners"
"19"	"it would, because then we’d have as many years as we wanted, and no"
"20"	"hurry; and we wouldn’t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while"
"21"	"they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn’t get blistered, and"
"22"	"we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,"
"23"	"and the way it ought to be done.  But _we_ can’t fool along; we got to"
"24"	"rush; we ain’t got no time to spare.  If we was to put in another"
"25"	"night this way we’d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get"
"26"	"well--couldn’t touch a case-knife with them sooner.”"
"27"	"“Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?”"
"28"	"“I’ll tell you.  It ain’t right, and it ain’t moral, and I wouldn’t like"
"29"	"it to get out; but there ain’t only just the one way:  we got to dig him"
"30"	"out with the picks, and _let on_ it’s case-knives.”"
"31"	"“_Now_ you’re _talking_!”  I says; “your head gets leveler and leveler"
"32"	"all the time, Tom Sawyer,” I says.  “Picks is the thing, moral or no"
"33"	"moral; and as for me, I don’t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow."
"34"	" When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school"
"35"	"book, I ain’t no ways particular how it’s done so it’s done.  What I"
"36"	"want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my"
"37"	"Sunday-school book; and if a pick’s the handiest thing, that’s the thing"
"38"	"I’m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school"
"39"	"book out with; and I don’t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks"
"40"	"about it nuther.”"
"41"	"“Well,” he says, “there’s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like"
"42"	"this; if it warn’t so, I wouldn’t approve of it, nor I wouldn’t stand by"
"43"	"and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong,"
"44"	"and a body ain’t got no business doing wrong when he ain’t ignorant and"
"45"	"knows better.  It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out with a pick,"
"46"	"_without_ any letting on, because you don’t know no better; but it"
"47"	"wouldn’t for me, because I do know better.  Gimme a case-knife.”"
"48"	"He had his own by him, but I handed him mine.  He flung it down, and"
"49"	"says:"
"50"	"“Gimme a _case-knife_.”"
"51"	"I didn’t know just what to do--but then I thought.  I scratched around"
"52"	"amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took"
"53"	"it and went to work, and never said a word."
"54"	"He was always just that particular.  Full of principle."
"55"	"So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,"
"56"	"and made the fur fly.  We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as"
"57"	"long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for"
"58"	"it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing"
"59"	"his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn’t come it, his"
"60"	"hands was so sore.  At last he says:"
"61"	"“It ain’t no use, it can’t be done.  What you reckon I better do?  Can’t"
"62"	"you think of no way?”"
"63"	"“Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain’t regular.  Come up the stairs, and"
"64"	"let on it’s a lightning-rod.”"
"65"	"So he done it."
"66"	"Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,"
"67"	"for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I"
"68"	"hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin"
"69"	"plates.  Tom says it wasn’t enough; but I said nobody wouldn’t ever see"
"70"	"the plates that Jim throwed out, because they’d fall in the dog-fennel"
"71"	"and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and"
"72"	"he could use them over again.  So Tom was satisfied.  Then he says:"
"73"	"“Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.”"
"74"	"“Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it done.”"
"75"	"He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard"
"76"	"of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.  By and by he"
"77"	"said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn’t no need to"
"78"	"decide on any of them yet.  Said we’d got to post Jim first."
"79"	"That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took"
"80"	"one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard"
"81"	"Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn’t wake him.  Then we"
"82"	"whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half"
"83"	"the job was done.  We crept in under Jim’s bed and into the cabin, and"
"84"	"pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,"
"85"	"and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle"
"86"	"and gradual.  He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us"
"87"	"honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us"
"88"	"hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,"
"89"	"and clearing out without losing any time.  But Tom he showed him how"
"90"	"unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,"
"91"	"and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and"
"92"	"not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_."
"93"	" So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old"
"94"	"times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told"
"95"	"him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt"
"96"	"Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and"
"97"	"both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:"
"98"	"“_Now_ I know how to fix it.  We’ll send you some things by them.”"
"99"	"I said, “Don’t do nothing of the kind; it’s one of the most jackass"
"100"	"ideas I ever struck;” but he never paid no attention to me; went right"
"101"	"on.  It was his way when he’d got his plans set."
"102"	"So he told Jim how we’d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other"
"103"	"large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the"
"104"	"lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and"
"105"	"we would put small things in uncle’s coat-pockets and he must steal them"
"106"	"out; and we would tie things to aunt’s apron-strings or put them in her"
"107"	"apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and"
"108"	"what they was for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with"
"109"	"his blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn’t see"
"110"	"no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed"
"111"	"better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just"
"112"	"as Tom said."
"113"	"Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good"
"114"	"sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to"
"115"	"bed, with hands that looked like they’d been chawed.  Tom was in high"
"116"	"spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the"
"117"	"most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would"
"118"	"keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to"
"119"	"get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the"
"120"	"more he got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung out"
"121"	"to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  And he"
"122"	"said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it."
"123"	"In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass"
"124"	"candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in"
"125"	"his pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat’s"
"126"	"notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a"
"127"	"corn-pone that was in Jim’s pan, and we went along with Nat to see how"
"128"	"it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most"
"129"	"mashed all his teeth out; and there warn’t ever anything could a worked"
"130"	"better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only"
"131"	"just a piece of rock or something like that that’s always getting into"
"132"	"bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he"
"133"	"jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first."
"134"	"And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a"
"135"	"couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim’s bed; and they kept on"
"136"	"piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn’t hardly room"
"137"	"in there to get your breath.  By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to"
"138"	"door!  The nigger Nat he only just hollered “Witches” once, and keeled"
"139"	"over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was"
"140"	"dying.  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim’s meat,"
"141"	"and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back"
"142"	"again and shut the door, and I knowed he’d fixed the other door too."
"143"	"Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and"
"144"	"asking him if he’d been imagining he saw something again.  He raised up,"
"145"	"and blinked his eyes around, and says:"
"146"	"“Mars Sid, you’ll say I’s a fool, but if I didn’t b’lieve I see most a"
"147"	"million dogs, er devils, er some’n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese"
"148"	"tracks.  I did, mos’ sholy.  Mars Sid, I _felt_ um--I _felt_ um, sah; dey"
"149"	"was all over me.  Dad fetch it, I jis’ wisht I could git my han’s on one"
"150"	"er dem witches jis’ wunst--on’y jis’ wunst--it’s all I’d ast.  But mos’ly"
"151"	"I wisht dey’d lemme ‘lone, I does.”"
"152"	"Tom says:"
"153"	"“Well, I tell you what I think.  What makes them come here just at this"
"154"	"runaway nigger’s breakfast-time?  It’s because they’re hungry; that’s"
"155"	"the reason.  You make them a witch pie; that’s the thing for _you_ to"
"156"	"do.”"
"157"	"“But my lan’, Mars Sid, how’s I gwyne to make ‘m a witch pie?  I doan’"
"158"	"know how to make it.  I hain’t ever hearn er sich a thing b’fo’.”"
"159"	"“Well, then, I’ll have to make it myself.”"
"160"	"“Will you do it, honey?--will you?  I’ll wusshup de groun’ und’ yo’ foot,"
"161"	"I will!”"
"162"	"“All right, I’ll do it, seeing it’s you, and you’ve been good to us and"
"163"	"showed us the runaway nigger.  But you got to be mighty careful.  When"
"164"	"we come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we’ve put in the"
"165"	"pan, don’t you let on you see it at all.  And don’t you look when Jim"
"166"	"unloads the pan--something might happen, I don’t know what.  And above"
"167"	"all, don’t you _handle_ the witch-things.”"
"168"	"“_Hannel ‘M_, Mars Sid?  What _is_ you a-talkin’ ‘bout?  I wouldn’"
"169"	"lay de weight er my finger on um, not f’r ten hund’d thous’n billion"
"170"	"dollars, I wouldn’t.”"
