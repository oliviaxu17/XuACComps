"2"	"However, as I grew better acquainted with the business and learned the"
"3"	"run of the sources of information I ceased to require the aid of fancy to"
"4"	"any large extent, and became able to fill my columns without diverging"
"5"	"noticeably from the domain of fact."
"6"	"I struck up friendships with the reporters of the other journals, and we"
"7"	"swapped “regulars” with each other and thus economized work.  “Regulars”"
"8"	" are permanent sources of news, like courts, bullion returns, “clean-ups”"
"9"	" at the quartz mills, and inquests.  Inasmuch as everybody went armed, we"
"10"	"had an inquest about every day, and so this department was naturally set"
"11"	"down among the “regulars.”  We had lively papers in those days.  My great"
"12"	"competitor among the reporters was Boggs of the Union.  He was an"
"13"	"excellent reporter.  Once in three or four months he would get a little"
"14"	"intoxicated, but as a general thing he was a wary and cautious drinker"
"15"	"although always ready to tamper a little with the enemy.  He had the"
"16"	"advantage of me in one thing; he could get the monthly public school"
"17"	"report and I could not, because the principal hated the Enterprise."
"18"	"One snowy night when the report was due, I started out sadly wondering"
"19"	"how I was going to get it.  Presently, a few steps up the almost deserted"
"20"	"street I stumbled on Boggs and asked him where he was going."
"21"	"“After the school report.”"
"22"	"“I’ll go along with you.”"
"23"	"“No, sir.  I’ll excuse you.”"
"24"	"“Just as you say.”"
"25"	"A saloon-keeper’s boy passed by with a steaming pitcher of hot punch, and"
"26"	"Boggs snuffed the fragrance gratefully.  He gazed fondly after the boy"
"27"	"and saw him start up the Enterprise stairs.  I said:"
"28"	"“I wish you could help me get that school business, but since you can’t,"
"29"	"I must run up to the Union office and see if I can get them to let me"
"30"	"have a proof of it after they have set it up, though I don’t begin to"
"31"	"suppose they will.  Good night.”"
"32"	"“Hold on a minute.  I don’t mind getting the report and sitting around"
"33"	"with the boys a little, while you copy it, if you’re willing to drop down"
"34"	"to the principal’s with me.”"
"35"	"“Now you talk like a rational being.  Come along.”"
"36"	"We plowed a couple of blocks through the snow, got the report and"
"37"	"returned to our office.  It was a short document and soon copied."
"38"	"Meantime Boggs helped himself to the punch.  I gave the manuscript back"
"39"	"to him and we started out to get an inquest, for we heard pistol shots"
"40"	"near by.  We got the particulars with little loss of time, for it was"
"41"	"only an inferior sort of bar-room murder, and of little interest to the"
"42"	"public, and then we separated.  Away at three o’clock in the morning,"
"43"	"when we had gone to press and were having a relaxing concert as usual"
"44"	"--for some of the printers were good singers and others good performers on"
"45"	"the guitar and on that atrocity the accordion--the proprietor of the"
"46"	"Union strode in and desired to know if anybody had heard anything of"
"47"	"Boggs or the school report.  We stated the case, and all turned out to"
"48"	"help hunt for the delinquent.  We found him standing on a table in a"
"49"	"saloon, with an old tin lantern in one hand and the school report in the"
"50"	"other, haranguing a gang of intoxicated Cornish miners on the iniquity of"
"51"	"squandering the public moneys on education “when hundreds and hundreds of"
"52"	"honest hard-working men are literally starving for whiskey.”  [Riotous"
"53"	"applause.]  He had been assisting in a regal spree with those parties for"
"54"	"hours.  We dragged him away and put him to bed."
"55"	"Of course there was no school report in the Union, and Boggs held me"
"56"	"accountable, though I was innocent of any intention or desire to compass"
"57"	"its absence from that paper and was as sorry as any one that the"
"58"	"misfortune had occurred."
"59"	"But we were perfectly friendly.  The day that the school report was next"
"60"	"due, the proprietor of the “Genessee” mine furnished us a buggy and asked"
"61"	"us to go down and write something about the property--a very common"
"62"	"request and one always gladly acceded to when people furnished buggies,"
"63"	"for we were as fond of pleasure excursions as other people.  In due time"
"64"	"we arrived at the “mine”--nothing but a hole in the ground ninety feet"
"65"	"deep, and no way of getting down into it but by holding on to a rope and"
"66"	"being lowered with a windlass.  The workmen had just gone off somewhere"
"67"	"to dinner.  I was not strong enough to lower Boggs’s bulk; so I took an"
"68"	"unlighted candle in my teeth, made a loop for my foot in the end of the"
"69"	"rope, implored Boggs not to go to sleep or let the windlass get the start"
"70"	"of him, and then swung out over the shaft.  I reached the bottom muddy"
"71"	"and bruised about the elbows, but safe.  I lit the candle, made an"
"72"	"examination of the rock, selected some specimens and shouted to Boggs to"
"73"	"hoist away.  No answer.  Presently a head appeared in the circle of"
"74"	"daylight away aloft, and a voice came down:"
"75"	"“Are you all set?”"
"76"	"“All set--hoist away.”"
"77"	"“Are you comfortable?”"
"78"	"“Perfectly.”"
"79"	"“Could you wait a little?”"
"80"	"“Oh certainly--no particular hurry.”"
"81"	"“Well--good by.”"
"82"	"“Why?  Where are you going?”"
"83"	"“After the school report!”"
"84"	"And he did.  I staid down there an hour, and surprised the workmen when"
"85"	"they hauled up and found a man on the rope instead of a bucket of rock."
"86"	"I walked home, too--five miles--up hill.  We had no school report next"
"87"	"morning; but the Union had."
"88"	"Six months after my entry into journalism the grand “flush times” of"
"89"	"Silverland began, and they continued with unabated splendor for three"
"90"	"years.  All difficulty about filling up the “local department” ceased,"
"91"	"and the only trouble now was how to make the lengthened columns hold the"
"92"	"world of incidents and happenings that came to our literary net every"
"93"	"day.  Virginia had grown to be the “livest” town, for its age and"
"94"	"population, that America had ever produced.  The sidewalks swarmed with"
"95"	"people--to such an extent, indeed, that it was generally no easy matter"
"96"	"to stem the human tide.  The streets themselves were just as crowded with"
"97"	"quartz wagons, freight teams and other vehicles.  The procession was"
"98"	"endless.  So great was the pack, that buggies frequently had to wait half"
"99"	"an hour for an opportunity to cross the principal street.  Joy sat on"
"100"	"every countenance, and there was a glad, almost fierce, intensity in"
"101"	"every eye, that told of the money-getting schemes that were seething in"
"102"	"every brain and the high hope that held sway in every heart.  Money was"
"103"	"as plenty as dust; every individual considered himself wealthy, and a"
"104"	"melancholy countenance was nowhere to be seen.  There were military"
"105"	"companies, fire companies, brass bands, banks, hotels, theatres,"
"106"	"“hurdy-gurdy houses,” wide-open gambling palaces, political pow-wows,"
"107"	"civic processions, street fights, murders, inquests, riots, a whiskey"
"108"	"mill every fifteen steps, a Board of Aldermen, a Mayor, a City Surveyor,"
"109"	"a City Engineer, a Chief of the Fire Department, with First, Second and"
"110"	"Third Assistants, a Chief of Police, City Marshal and a large police"
"111"	"force, two Boards of Mining Brokers, a dozen breweries and half a dozen"
"112"	"jails and station-houses in full operation, and some talk of building a"
"113"	"church.  The “flush times” were in magnificent flower!  Large fire-proof"
"114"	"brick buildings were going up in the principal streets, and the wooden"
"115"	"suburbs were spreading out in all directions.  Town lots soared up to"
"116"	"prices that were amazing."
"117"	"The great “Comstock lode” stretched its opulent length straight through"
"118"	"the town from north to south, and every mine on it was in diligent"
"119"	"process of development.  One of these mines alone employed six hundred"
"120"	"and seventy-five men, and in the matter of elections the adage was, “as"
"121"	"the ‘Gould and Curry’ goes, so goes the city.”  Laboring men’s wages were"
"122"	"four and six dollars a day, and they worked in three “shifts” or gangs,"
"123"	"and the blasting and picking and shoveling went on without ceasing, night"
"124"	"and day."
"125"	"The “city” of Virginia roosted royally midway up the steep side of Mount"
"126"	"Davidson, seven thousand two hundred feet above the level of the sea, and"
"127"	"in the clear Nevada atmosphere was visible from a distance of fifty"
"128"	"miles!  It claimed a population of fifteen thousand to eighteen thousand,"
"129"	"and all day long half of this little army swarmed the streets like bees"
"130"	"and the other half swarmed among the drifts and tunnels of the"
"131"	"“Comstock,” hundreds of feet down in the earth directly under those same"
"132"	"streets.  Often we felt our chairs jar, and heard the faint boom of a"
"133"	"blast down in the bowels of the earth under the office."
"134"	"The mountain side was so steep that the entire town had a slant to it"
"135"	"like a roof.  Each street was a terrace, and from each to the next street"
"136"	"below the descent was forty or fifty feet.  The fronts of the houses were"
"137"	"level with the street they faced, but their rear first floors were"
"138"	"propped on lofty stilts; a man could stand at a rear first floor window"
"139"	"of a C street house and look down the chimneys of the row of houses below"
"140"	"him facing D street.  It was a laborious climb, in that thin atmosphere,"
"141"	"to ascend from D to A street, and you were panting and out of breath when"
"142"	"you got there; but you could turn around and go down again like a house"
"143"	"a-fire--so to speak.  The atmosphere was so rarified, on account of the"
"144"	"great altitude, that one’s blood lay near the surface always, and the"
"145"	"scratch of a pin was a disaster worth worrying about, for the chances"
"146"	"were that a grievous erysipelas would ensue.  But to offset this, the"
"147"	"thin atmosphere seemed to carry healing to gunshot wounds, and therefore,"
"148"	"to simply shoot your adversary through both lungs was a thing not likely"
"149"	"to afford you any permanent satisfaction, for he would be nearly certain"
"150"	"to be around looking for you within the month, and not with an opera"
"151"	"glass, either."
"152"	"From Virginia’s airy situation one could look over a vast, far-reaching"
"153"	"panorama of mountain ranges and deserts; and whether the day was bright"
"154"	"or overcast, whether the sun was rising or setting, or flaming in the"
"155"	"zenith, or whether night and the moon held sway, the spectacle was always"
"156"	"impressive and beautiful.  Over your head Mount Davidson lifted its gray"
"157"	"dome, and before and below you a rugged canyon clove the battlemented"
"158"	"hills, making a sombre gateway through which a soft-tinted desert was"
"159"	"glimpsed, with the silver thread of a river winding through it, bordered"
"160"	"with trees which many miles of distance diminished to a delicate fringe;"
"161"	"and still further away the snowy mountains rose up and stretched their"
"162"	"long barrier to the filmy horizon--far enough beyond a lake that burned"
"163"	"in the desert like a fallen sun, though that, itself, lay fifty miles"
"164"	"removed.  Look from your window where you would, there was fascination in"
"165"	"the picture.  At rare intervals--but very rare--there were clouds in our"
"166"	"skies, and then the setting sun would gild and flush and glorify this"
"167"	"mighty expanse of scenery with a bewildering pomp of color that held the"
"168"	"eye like a spell and moved the spirit like music."
