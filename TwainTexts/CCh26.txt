"2"	"THE FIRST NEWSPAPER"
"3"	"When I told the king I was going out disguised as a petty freeman"
"4"	"to scour the country and familiarize myself with the humbler life"
"5"	"of the people, he was all afire with the novelty of the thing"
"6"	"in a minute, and was bound to take a chance in the adventure"
"7"	"himself--nothing should stop him--he would drop everything and"
"8"	"go along--it was the prettiest idea he had run across for many"
"9"	"a day.  He wanted to glide out the back way and start at once;"
"10"	"but I showed him that that wouldn’t answer.  You see, he was billed"
"11"	"for the king’s-evil--to touch for it, I mean--and it wouldn’t be"
"12"	"right to disappoint the house and it wouldn’t make a delay worth"
"13"	"considering, anyway, it was only a one-night stand.  And I thought"
"14"	"he ought to tell the queen he was going away.  He clouded up at"
"15"	"that and looked sad.  I was sorry I had spoken, especially when"
"16"	"he said mournfully:"
"17"	"“Thou forgettest that Launcelot is here; and where Launcelot is,"
"18"	"she noteth not the going forth of the king, nor what day he returneth.”"
"19"	"Of course, I changed the Subject.  Yes, Guenever was beautiful,"
"20"	"it is true, but take her all around she was pretty slack.  I never"
"21"	"meddled in these matters, they weren’t my affair, but I did hate"
"22"	"to see the way things were going on, and I don’t mind saying that"
"23"	"much.  Many’s the time she had asked me, “Sir Boss, hast seen"
"24"	"Sir Launcelot about?” but if ever she went fretting around for"
"25"	"the king I didn’t happen to be around at the time."
"26"	"There was a very good lay-out for the king’s-evil business--very"
"27"	"tidy and creditable.  The king sat under a canopy of state; about"
"28"	"him were clustered a large body of the clergy in full canonicals."
"29"	"Conspicuous, both for location and personal outfit, stood Marinel,"
"30"	"a hermit of the quack-doctor species, to introduce the sick.  All"
"31"	"abroad over the spacious floor, and clear down to the doors,"
"32"	"in a thick jumble, lay or sat the scrofulous, under a strong light."
"33"	"It was as good as a tableau; in fact, it had all the look of being"
"34"	"gotten up for that, though it wasn’t.  There were eight hundred"
"35"	"sick people present.  The work was slow; it lacked the interest"
"36"	"of novelty for me, because I had seen the ceremonies before;"
"37"	"the thing soon became tedious, but the proprieties required me"
"38"	"to stick it out.  The doctor was there for the reason that in all"
"39"	"such crowds there were many people who only imagined something"
"40"	"was the matter with them, and many who were consciously sound"
"41"	"but wanted the immortal honor of fleshly contact with a king, and"
"42"	"yet others who pretended to illness in order to get the piece of"
"43"	"coin that went with the touch.  Up to this time this coin had been"
"44"	"a wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar.  When you"
"45"	"consider how much that amount of money would buy, in that age"
"46"	"and country, and how usual it was to be scrofulous, when not dead,"
"47"	"you would understand that the annual king’s-evil appropriation was"
"48"	"just the River and Harbor bill of that government for the grip it"
"49"	"took on the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning the"
"50"	"surplus.  So I had privately concluded to touch the treasury itself"
"51"	"for the king’s-evil.  I covered six-sevenths of the appropriation"
"52"	"into the treasury a week before starting from Camelot on my"
"53"	"adventures, and ordered that the other seventh be inflated into"
"54"	"five-cent nickels and delivered into the hands of the head clerk"
"55"	"of the King’s Evil Department; a nickel to take the place of each"
"56"	"gold coin, you see, and do its work for it.  It might strain the"
"57"	"nickel some, but I judged it could stand it.  As a rule, I do not"
"58"	"approve of watering stock, but I considered it square enough"
"59"	"in this case, for it was just a gift, anyway.  Of course, you can"
"60"	"water a gift as much as you want to; and I generally do.  The old"
"61"	"gold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown"
"62"	"origin, as a rule, but some of them were Roman; they were ill-shapen,"
"63"	"and seldom rounder than a moon that is a week past the full; they"
"64"	"were hammered, not minted, and they were so worn with use that"
"65"	"the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters, and looked"
"66"	"like them.  I judged that a sharp, bright new nickel, with a"
"67"	"first-rate likeness of the king on one side of it and Guenever"
"68"	"on the other, and a blooming pious motto, would take the tuck out"
"69"	"of scrofula as handy as a nobler coin and please the scrofulous"
"70"	"fancy more; and I was right.  This batch was the first it was"
"71"	"tried on, and it worked to a charm.  The saving in expense was"
"72"	"a notable economy.  You will see that by these figures: We touched"
"73"	"a trifle over 700 of the 800 patients; at former rates, this would"
"74"	"have cost the government about $240; at the new rate we pulled"
"75"	"through for about $35, thus saving upward of $200 at one swoop."
"76"	"To appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke, consider these"
"77"	"other figures: the annual expenses of a national government amount"
"78"	"to the equivalent of a contribution of three days’ average wages of"
"79"	"every individual of the population, counting every individual as"
"80"	"if he were a man.  If you take a nation of 60,000,000, where average"
"81"	"wages are $2 per day, three days’ wages taken from each individual"
"82"	"will provide $360,000,000 and pay the government’s expenses.  In my"
"83"	"day, in my own country, this money was collected from imposts,"
"84"	"and the citizen imagined that the foreign importer paid it, and it"
"85"	"made him comfortable to think so; whereas, in fact, it was paid"
"86"	"by the American people, and was so equally and exactly distributed"
"87"	"among them that the annual cost to the 100-millionaire and the"
"88"	"annual cost to the sucking child of the day-laborer was precisely"
"89"	"the same--each paid $6.  Nothing could be equaler than that,"
"90"	"I reckon.  Well, Scotland and Ireland were tributary to Arthur,"
"91"	"and the united populations of the British Islands amounted to"
"92"	"something less than 1,000,000.  A mechanic’s average wage was"
"93"	"3 cents a day, when he paid his own keep.  By this rule the national"
"94"	"government’s expenses were $90,000 a year, or about $250 a day."
"95"	"Thus, by the substitution of nickels for gold on a king’s-evil"
"96"	"day, I not only injured no one, dissatisfied no one, but pleased"
"97"	"all concerned and saved four-fifths of that day’s national expense"
"98"	"into the bargain--a saving which would have been the equivalent"
"99"	"of $800,000 in my day in America.  In making this substitution"
"100"	"I had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote source--the wisdom"
"101"	"of my boyhood--for the true statesman does not despise any wisdom,"
"102"	"howsoever lowly may be its origin: in my boyhood I had always"
"103"	"saved my pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionary"
"104"	"cause.  The buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well as"
"105"	"the coin, the coin would answer me better than the buttons; all"
"106"	"hands were happy and nobody hurt."
"107"	"Marinel took the patients as they came.  He examined the candidate;"
"108"	"if he couldn’t qualify he was warned off; if he could he was passed"
"109"	"along to the king.  A priest pronounced the words, “They shall"
"110"	"lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”  Then the king"
"111"	"stroked the ulcers, while the reading continued; finally, the"
"112"	"patient graduated and got his nickel--the king hanging it around"
"113"	"his neck himself--and was dismissed.  Would you think that that"
"114"	"would cure?  It certainly did.  Any mummery will cure if the"
"115"	"patient’s faith is strong in it.  Up by Astolat there was a chapel"
"116"	"where the Virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herd"
"117"	"geese around there--the girl said so herself--and they built the"
"118"	"chapel upon that spot and hung a picture in it representing the"
"119"	"occurrence--a picture which you would think it dangerous for a sick"
"120"	"person to approach; whereas, on the contrary, thousands of the lame"
"121"	"and the sick came and prayed before it every year and went away"
"122"	"whole and sound; and even the well could look upon it and live."
"123"	"Of course, when I was told these things I did not believe them;"
"124"	"but when I went there and saw them I had to succumb.  I saw the"
"125"	"cures effected myself; and they were real cures and not questionable."
"126"	"I saw cripples whom I had seen around Camelot for years on crutches,"
"127"	"arrive and pray before that picture, and put down their crutches"
"128"	"and walk off without a limp.  There were piles of crutches there"
"129"	"which had been left by such people as a testimony."
"130"	"In other places people operated on a patient’s mind, without saying"
"131"	"a word to him, and cured him.  In others, experts assembled patients"
"132"	"in a room and prayed over them, and appealed to their faith, and"
"133"	"those patients went away cured.  Wherever you find a king who can’t"
"134"	"cure the king’s-evil you can be sure that the most valuable"
"135"	"superstition that supports his throne--the subject’s belief in"
"136"	"the divine appointment of his sovereign--has passed away.  In my"
"137"	"youth the monarchs of England had ceased to touch for the evil,"
"138"	"but there was no occasion for this diffidence: they could have"
"139"	"cured it forty-nine times in fifty."
"140"	"Well, when the priest had been droning for three hours, and the"
"141"	"good king polishing the evidences, and the sick were still pressing"
"142"	"forward as plenty as ever, I got to feeling intolerably bored."
"143"	"I was sitting by an open window not far from the canopy of state."
"144"	"For the five hundredth time a patient stood forward to have his"
"145"	"repulsivenesses stroked; again those words were being droned out:"
"146"	"“they shall lay their hands on the sick”--when outside there rang"
"147"	"clear as a clarion a note that enchanted my soul and tumbled"
"148"	"thirteen worthless centuries about my ears: “Camelot _Weekly"
"149"	"Hosannah and Literary Volcano!_--latest irruption--only two cents"
"150"	"--all about the big miracle in the Valley of Holiness!”  One greater"
"151"	"than kings had arrived--the newsboy.  But I was the only person"
"152"	"in all that throng who knew the meaning of this mighty birth, and"
"153"	"what this imperial magician was come into the world to do."
"154"	"I dropped a nickel out of the window and got my paper; the"
"155"	"Adam-newsboy of the world went around the corner to get my change;"
"156"	"is around the corner yet.  It was delicious to see a newspaper"
"157"	"again, yet I was conscious of a secret shock when my eye fell upon"
"158"	"the first batch of display head-lines.  I had lived in a clammy"
"159"	"atmosphere of reverence, respect, deference, so long that they"
"160"	"sent a quivery little cold wave through me:"
"161"	"              HIGH TIMES IN THE VALLEY"
"162"	"                    OF HOLINESS!"
"163"	"                        ----"
"164"	"               THE WATER-WORKS CORKED!"

"166"	"         BRER MERLIN WORKS HIS ARTS, BUT GETS"
"167"	"                        LEFT?"

"169"	"      But the Boss scores on his first Innings!"

"179"	"--and so on, and so on.  Yes, it was too loud.  Once I could have"
"180"	"enjoyed it and seen nothing out of the way about it, but now its"
"181"	"note was discordant.  It was good Arkansas journalism, but this"
"182"	"was not Arkansas.  Moreover, the next to the last line was calculated"
"183"	"to give offense to the hermits, and perhaps lose us their advertising."
"184"	"Indeed, there was too lightsome a tone of flippancy all through"
"185"	"the paper.  It was plain I had undergone a considerable change"
"186"	"without noticing it.  I found myself unpleasantly affected by"
"187"	"pert little irreverencies which would have seemed but proper and"
"188"	"airy graces of speech at an earlier period of my life.  There was an"
"189"	"abundance of the following breed of items, and they discomforted me:"
"190"	"   LOCAL SMOKE AND CINDERS."

"246"	"Of course it was good enough journalism for a beginning; I knew"
"247"	"that quite well, and yet it was somehow disappointing.  The"
"248"	"“Court Circular” pleased me better; indeed, its simple and dignified"
"249"	"respectfulness was a distinct refreshment to me after all those"
"250"	"disgraceful familiarities.  But even it could have been improved."
"251"	"Do what one may, there is no getting an air of variety into a court"
"252"	"circular, I acknowledge that.  There is a profound monotonousness"
"253"	"about its facts that baffles and defeats one’s sincerest efforts"
"254"	"to make them sparkle and enthuse.  The best way to manage--in fact,"
"255"	"the only sensible way--is to disguise repetitiousness of fact under"
"256"	"variety of form: skin your fact each time and lay on a new cuticle"
"257"	"of words.  It deceives the eye; you think it is a new fact; it"
"258"	"gives you the idea that the court is carrying on like everything;"
"259"	"this excites you, and you drain the whole column, with a good"
"260"	"appetite, and perhaps never notice that it’s a barrel of soup made"
"261"	"out of a single bean.  Clarence’s way was good, it was simple,"
"262"	"it was dignified, it was direct and business-like; all I say is,"
"263"	"it was not the best way:"
"264"	"             COURT CIRCULAR."
"265"	"   On Monday, the king rode in the park."
"266"	"   “  Tuesday,      “      “        ”"
"267"	"    “  Wendesday     “      “        ”"
"268"	"    “  Thursday      “      “        ”"
"269"	"    “  Friday,       “      “        ”"
"270"	"    “  Saturday      “      “        ”"
"271"	"    “  Sunday,       “      “        ”"
"272"	"However, take the paper by and large, I was vastly pleased with it."
"273"	"Little crudities of a mechanical sort were observable here and"
"274"	"there, but there were not enough of them to amount to anything,"
"275"	"and it was good enough Arkansas proof-reading, anyhow, and better"
"276"	"than was needed in Arthur’s day and realm.  As a rule, the grammar"
"277"	"was leaky and the construction more or less lame; but I did not"
"278"	"much mind these things.  They are common defects of my own, and"
"279"	"one mustn’t criticise other people on grounds where he can’t stand"
"280"	"perpendicular himself."
"281"	"I was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole"
"282"	"paper at this one meal, but I got only a few bites, and then had"
"283"	"to postpone, because the monks around me besieged me so with eager"
"284"	"questions: What is this curious thing?  What is it for?  Is it a"
"285"	"handkerchief?--saddle blanket?--part of a shirt?  What is it made of?"
"286"	"How thin it is, and how dainty and frail; and how it rattles."
"287"	"Will it wear, do you think, and won’t the rain injure it?  Is it"
"288"	"writing that appears on it, or is it only ornamentation?  They"
"289"	"suspected it was writing, because those among them who knew how"
"290"	"to read Latin and had a smattering of Greek, recognized some of"
"291"	"the letters, but they could make nothing out of the result as a"
"292"	"whole.  I put my information in the simplest form I could:"
"293"	"“It is a public journal; I will explain what that is, another time."
"294"	"It is not cloth, it is made of paper; some time I will explain"
"295"	"what paper is.  The lines on it are reading matter; and not written"
"296"	"by hand, but printed; by and by I will explain what printing is."
"297"	"A thousand of these sheets have been made, all exactly like this,"
"298"	"in every minute detail--they can’t be told apart.”  Then they all"
"299"	"broke out with exclamations of surprise and admiration:"
"300"	"“A thousand!  Verily a mighty work--a year’s work for many men.”"
"301"	"“No--merely a day’s work for a man and a boy.”"
"302"	"They crossed themselves, and whiffed out a protective prayer or two."
"303"	"“Ah-h--a miracle, a wonder!  Dark work of enchantment.”"
"304"	"I let it go at that.  Then I read in a low voice, to as many as"
"305"	"could crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance, part of"
"306"	"the account of the miracle of the restoration of the well, and"
"307"	"was accompanied by astonished and reverent ejaculations all through:"
"308"	"“Ah-h-h!”  “How true!”  “Amazing, amazing!”  “These be the very"
"309"	"haps as they happened, in marvelous exactness!”  And might they"
"310"	"take this strange thing in their hands, and feel of it and examine"
"311"	"it?--they would be very careful.  Yes.  So they took it, handling"
"312"	"it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had been some holy thing"
"313"	"come from some supernatural region; and gently felt of its texture,"
"314"	"caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering touch, and"
"315"	"scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes.  These"
"316"	"grouped bent heads, these charmed faces, these speaking eyes"
"317"	"--how beautiful to me!  For was not this my darling, and was not"
"318"	"all this mute wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent"
"319"	"tribute and unforced compliment to it?  I knew, then, how a mother"
"320"	"feels when women, whether strangers or friends, take her new baby,"
"321"	"and close themselves about it with one eager impulse, and bend"
"322"	"their heads over it in a tranced adoration that makes all the rest"
"323"	"of the universe vanish out of their consciousness and be as if it"
"324"	"were not, for that time.  I knew how she feels, and that there is"
"325"	"no other satisfied ambition, whether of king, conqueror, or poet,"
"326"	"that ever reaches half-way to that serene far summit or yields half"
"327"	"so divine a contentment."
"328"	"During all the rest of the seance my paper traveled from group to"
"329"	"group all up and down and about that huge hall, and my happy eye"
"330"	"was upon it always, and I sat motionless, steeped in satisfaction,"
"331"	"drunk with enjoyment.  Yes, this was heaven; I was tasting it once,"
"332"	"if I might never taste it more."
