"2"	"Magdala is not a beautiful place.  It is thoroughly Syrian, and that is"
"3"	"to say that it is thoroughly ugly, and cramped, squalid, uncomfortable,"
"4"	"and filthy--just the style of cities that have adorned the country since"
"5"	"Adam’s time, as all writers have labored hard to prove, and have"
"6"	"succeeded.  The streets of Magdala are any where from three to six feet"
"7"	"wide, and reeking with uncleanliness.  The houses are from five to seven"
"8"	"feet high, and all built upon one arbitrary plan--the ungraceful form of"
"9"	"a dry-goods box.  The sides are daubed with a smooth white plaster, and"
"10"	"tastefully frescoed aloft and alow with disks of camel-dung placed there"
"11"	"to dry.  This gives the edifice the romantic appearance of having been"
"12"	"riddled with cannon-balls, and imparts to it a very warlike aspect.  When"
"13"	"the artist has arranged his materials with an eye to just proportion"
"14"	"--the small and the large flakes in alternate rows, and separated by"
"15"	"carefully-considered intervals--I know of nothing more cheerful to look"
"16"	"upon than a spirited Syrian fresco.  The flat, plastered roof is"
"17"	"garnished by picturesque stacks of fresco materials, which, having"
"18"	"become thoroughly dried and cured, are placed there where it will be"
"19"	"convenient.  It is used for fuel.  There is no timber of any consequence"
"20"	"in Palestine--none at all to waste upon fires--and neither are there any"
"21"	"mines of coal. If my description has been intelligible, you will"
"22"	"perceive, now, that a square, flat-roofed hovel, neatly frescoed, with"
"23"	"its wall-tops gallantly bastioned and turreted with dried camel-refuse,"
"24"	"gives to a landscape a feature that is exceedingly festive and"
"25"	"picturesque, especially if one is careful to remember to stick in a cat"
"26"	"wherever, about the premises, there is room for a cat to sit.  There are"
"27"	"no windows to a Syrian hut, and no chimneys.  When I used to read that"
"28"	"they let a bed-ridden man down through the roof of a house in Capernaum"
"29"	"to get him into the presence of the Saviour, I generally had a"
"30"	"three-story brick in my mind, and marveled that they did not break his"
"31"	"neck with the strange experiment.  I perceive now, however, that they"
"32"	"might have taken him by the heels and thrown him clear over the house"
"33"	"without discommoding him very much.  Palestine is not changed any since"
"34"	"those days, in manners, customs, architecture, or people."
"35"	"As we rode into Magdala not a soul was visible.  But the ring of the"
"36"	"horses’ hoofs roused the stupid population, and they all came trooping"
"37"	"out--old men and old women, boys and girls, the blind, the crazy, and the"
"38"	"crippled, all in ragged, soiled and scanty raiment, and all abject"
"39"	"beggars by nature, instinct and education.  How the vermin-tortured"
"40"	"vagabonds did swarm!  How they showed their scars and sores, and"
"41"	"piteously pointed to their maimed and crooked limbs, and begged with"
"42"	"their pleading eyes for charity!  We had invoked a spirit we could not"
"43"	"lay.  They hung to the horses’s tails, clung to their manes and the"
"44"	"stirrups, closed in on every aide in scorn of dangerous hoofs--and out of"
"45"	"their infidel throats, with one accord, burst an agonizing and most"
"46"	"infernal chorus: “Howajji, bucksheesh! howajji, bucksheesh! howajji,"
"47"	"bucksheesh! bucksheesh! bucksheesh!”  I never was in a storm like that"
"48"	"before."
"49"	"As we paid the bucksheesh out to sore-eyed children and brown, buxom"
"50"	"girls with repulsively tattooed lips and chins, we filed through the town"
"51"	"and by many an exquisite fresco, till we came to a bramble-infested"
"52"	"inclosure and a Roman-looking ruin which had been the veritable dwelling"
"53"	"of St. Mary Magdalene, the friend and follower of Jesus.  The guide"
"54"	"believed it, and so did I.  I could not well do otherwise, with the house"
"55"	"right there before my eyes as plain as day.  The pilgrims took down"
"56"	"portions of the front wall for specimens, as is their honored custom, and"
"57"	"then we departed."
"58"	"We are camped in this place, now, just within the city walls of Tiberias."
"59"	"We went into the town before nightfall and looked at its people--we cared"
"60"	"nothing about its houses.  Its people are best examined at a distance."
"61"	"They are particularly uncomely Jews, Arabs, and negroes.  Squalor and"
"62"	"poverty are the pride of Tiberias.  The young women wear their dower"
"63"	"strung upon a strong wire that curves downward from the top of the head"
"64"	"to the jaw--Turkish silver coins which they have raked together or"
"65"	"inherited.  Most of these maidens were not wealthy, but some few had been"
"66"	"very kindly dealt with by fortune.  I saw heiresses there worth, in their"
"67"	"own right--worth, well, I suppose I might venture to say, as much as nine"
"68"	"dollars and a half.  But such cases are rare.  When you come across one"
"69"	"of these, she naturally puts on airs.  She will not ask for bucksheesh."
"70"	"She will not even permit of undue familiarity.  She assumes a crushing"
"71"	"dignity and goes on serenely practicing with her fine-tooth comb and"
"72"	"quoting poetry just the same as if you were not present at all.  Some"
"73"	"people can not stand prosperity."
"74"	"They say that the long-nosed, lanky, dyspeptic-looking body-snatchers,"
"75"	"with the indescribable hats on, and a long curl dangling down in front of"
"76"	"each ear, are the old, familiar, self-righteous Pharisees we read of in"
"77"	"the Scriptures.  Verily, they look it.  Judging merely by their general"
"78"	"style, and without other evidence, one might easily suspect that"
"79"	"self-righteousness was their specialty."
"80"	"From various authorities I have culled information concerning Tiberias."
"81"	"It was built by Herod Antipas, the murderer of John the Baptist, and"
"82"	"named after the Emperor Tiberius.  It is believed that it stands upon the"
"83"	"site of what must have been, ages ago, a city of considerable"
"84"	"architectural pretensions, judging by the fine porphyry pillars that are"
"85"	"scattered through Tiberias and down the lake shore southward.  These were"
"86"	"fluted, once, and yet, although the stone is about as hard as iron, the"
"87"	"flutings are almost worn away.  These pillars are small, and doubtless"
"88"	"the edifices they adorned were distinguished more for elegance than"
"89"	"grandeur.  This modern town--Tiberias--is only mentioned in the New"
"90"	"Testament; never in the Old."
"91"	"The Sanhedrim met here last, and for three hundred years Tiberias was the"
"92"	"metropolis of the Jews in Palestine.  It is one of the four holy cities"
"93"	"of the Israelites, and is to them what Mecca is to the Mohammedan and"
"94"	"Jerusalem to the Christian.  It has been the abiding place of many"
"95"	"learned and famous Jewish rabbins.  They lie buried here, and near them"
"96"	"lie also twenty-five thousand of their faith who traveled far to be near"
"97"	"them while they lived and lie with them when they died.  The great Rabbi"
"98"	"Ben Israel spent three years here in the early part of the third century."
"99"	"He is dead, now."
"100"	"The celebrated Sea of Galilee is not so large a sea as Lake Tahoe"
"101"	"--[I measure all lakes by Tahoe, partly because I am far more familiar with"
"102"	"it than with any other, and partly because I have such a high admiration"
"103"	"for it and such a world of pleasant recollections of it, that it is very"
"104"	"nearly impossible for me to speak of lakes and not mention it.]--by a"
"105"	"good deal--it is just about two-thirds as large.  And when we come to"
"106"	"speak of beauty, this sea is no more to be compared to Tahoe than a"
"107"	"meridian of longitude is to a rainbow.  The dim waters of this pool can"
"108"	"not suggest the limpid brilliancy of Tahoe; these low, shaven, yellow"
"109"	"hillocks of rocks and sand, so devoid of perspective, can not suggest the"
"110"	"grand peaks that compass Tahoe like a wall, and whose ribbed and chasmed"
"111"	"fronts are clad with stately pines that seem to grow small and smaller as"
"112"	"they climb, till one might fancy them reduced to weeds and shrubs far"
"113"	"upward, where they join the everlasting snows.  Silence and solitude"
"114"	"brood over Tahoe; and silence and solitude brood also over this lake of"
"115"	"Genessaret.  But the solitude of the one is as cheerful and fascinating"
"116"	"as the solitude of the other is dismal and repellant."
"117"	"In the early morning one watches the silent battle of dawn and darkness"
"118"	"upon the waters of Tahoe with a placid interest; but when the shadows"
"119"	"sulk away and one by one the hidden beauties of the shore unfold"
"120"	"themselves in the full splendor of noon; when the still surface is belted"
"121"	"like a rainbow with broad bars of blue and green and white, half the"
"122"	"distance from circumference to centre; when, in the lazy summer"
"123"	"afternoon, he lies in a boat, far out to where the dead blue of the deep"
"124"	"water begins, and smokes the pipe of peace and idly winks at the"
"125"	"distant crags and patches of snow from under his cap-brim; when the boat"
"126"	"drifts shoreward to the white water, and he lolls over the gunwale and"
"127"	"gazes by the hour down through the crystal depths and notes the colors of"
"128"	"the pebbles and reviews the finny armies gliding in procession a hundred"
"129"	"feet below; when at night he sees moon and stars, mountain ridges"
"130"	"feathered with pines, jutting white capes, bold promontories, grand"
"131"	"sweeps of rugged scenery topped with bald, glimmering peaks, all"
"132"	"magnificently pictured in the polished mirror of the lake, in richest,"
"133"	"softest detail, the tranquil interest that was born with the morning"
"134"	"deepens and deepens, by sure degrees, till it culminates at last in"
"135"	"resistless fascination!"
"136"	"It is solitude, for birds and squirrels on the shore and fishes in the"
"137"	"water are all the creatures that are near to make it otherwise, but it is"
"138"	"not the sort of solitude to make one dreary.  Come to Galilee for that."
"139"	"If these unpeopled deserts, these rusty mounds of barrenness, that never,"
"140"	"never, never do shake the glare from their harsh outlines, and fade and"
"141"	"faint into vague perspective; that melancholy ruin of Capernaum; this"
"142"	"stupid village of Tiberias, slumbering under its six funereal plumes of"
"143"	"palms; yonder desolate declivity where the swine of the miracle ran down"
"144"	"into the sea, and doubtless thought it was better to swallow a devil or"
"145"	"two and get drowned into the bargain than have to live longer in such a"
"146"	"place; this cloudless, blistering sky; this solemn, sailless, tintless"
"147"	"lake, reposing within its rim of yellow hills and low, steep banks, and"
"148"	"looking just as expressionless and unpoetical (when we leave its sublime"
"149"	"history out of the question,) as any metropolitan reservoir in"
"150"	"Christendom--if these things are not food for rock me to sleep, mother,"
"151"	"none exist, I think."
"152"	"But I should not offer the evidence for the prosecution and leave the"
"153"	"defense unheard.  Wm. C. Grimes deposes as follows:--"
"154"	"     “We had taken ship to go over to the other side.  The sea was not"
"155"	"     more than six miles wide.  Of the beauty of the scene, however, I"
"156"	"     can not say enough, nor can I imagine where those travelers carried"
"157"	"     their eyes who have described the scenery of the lake as tame or"
"158"	"     uninteresting.  The first great characteristic of it is the deep"
"159"	"     basin in which it lies.  This is from three to four hundred feet"
"160"	"     deep on all sides except at the lower end, and the sharp slope of"
"161"	"     the banks, which are all of the richest green, is broken and"
"162"	"     diversified by the wadys and water-courses which work their way down"
"163"	"     through the sides of the basin, forming dark chasms or light sunny"
"164"	"     valleys.  Near Tiberias these banks are rocky, and ancient"
"165"	"     sepulchres open in them, with their doors toward the water.  They"
"166"	"     selected grand spots, as did the Egyptians of old, for burial"
"167"	"     places, as if they designed that when the voice of God should reach"
"168"	"     the sleepers, they should walk forth and open their eyes on scenes"
"169"	"     of glorious beauty.  On the east, the wild and desolate mountains"
"170"	"     contrast finely with the deep blue lake; and toward the north,"
"171"	"     sublime and majestic, Hermon looks down on the sea, lifting his"
"172"	"     white crown to heaven with the pride of a hill that has seen the"
"173"	"     departing footsteps of a hundred generations.  On the north-east"
"174"	"     shore of the sea was a single tree, and this is the only tree of any"
"175"	"     size visible from the water of the lake, except a few lonely palms"
"176"	"     in the city of Tiberias, and by its solitary position attracts more"
"177"	"     attention than would a forest.  The whole appearance of the scene is"
"178"	"     precisely what we would expect and desire the scenery of Genessaret"
"179"	"     to be, grand beauty, but quiet calm.  The very mountains are calm.”"
"180"	"It is an ingeniously written description, and well calculated to deceive."
"181"	"But if the paint and the ribbons and the flowers be stripped from it, a"
"182"	"skeleton will be found beneath."
"183"	"So stripped, there remains a lake six miles wide and neutral in color;"
"184"	"with steep green banks, unrelieved by shrubbery; at one end bare,"
"185"	"unsightly rocks, with (almost invisible) holes in them of no consequence"
"186"	"to the picture; eastward, “wild and desolate mountains;” (low, desolate"
"187"	"hills, he should have said;) in the north, a mountain called Hermon, with"
"188"	"snow on it; peculiarity of the picture, “calmness;” its prominent"
"189"	"feature, one tree."
"190"	"No ingenuity could make such a picture beautiful--to one’s actual vision."
"191"	"I claim the right to correct misstatements, and have so corrected the"
"192"	"color of the water in the above recapitulation.  The waters of Genessaret"
"193"	"are of an exceedingly mild blue, even from a high elevation and a"
"194"	"distance of five miles.  Close at hand (the witness was sailing on the"
"195"	"lake,) it is hardly proper to call them blue at all, much less “deep”"
"196"	" blue.  I wish to state, also, not as a correction, but as matter of"
"197"	"opinion, that Mount Hermon is not a striking or picturesque mountain by"
"198"	"any means, being too near the height of its immediate neighbors to be so."
"199"	"That is all.  I do not object to the witness dragging a mountain"
"200"	"forty-five miles to help the scenery under consideration, because it is"
"201"	"entirely proper to do it, and besides, the picture needs it."
"202"	"“C. W. E.,” (of “Life in the Holy Land,”) deposes as follows:--"
"203"	"     “A beautiful sea lies unbosomed among the Galilean hills, in the"
"204"	"     midst of that land once possessed by Zebulon and Naphtali, Asher and"
"205"	"     Dan.  The azure of the sky penetrates the depths of the lake, and"
"206"	"     the waters are sweet and cool.  On the west, stretch broad fertile"
"207"	"     plains; on the north the rocky shores rise step by step until in the"
"208"	"     far distance tower the snowy heights of Hermon; on the east through"
"209"	"     a misty veil are seen the high plains of Perea, which stretch away"
"210"	"     in rugged mountains leading the mind by varied paths toward"
"211"	"     Jerusalem the Holy.  Flowers bloom in this terrestrial paradise,"
"212"	"     once beautiful and verdant with waving trees; singing birds enchant"
"213"	"     the ear; the turtle-dove soothes with its soft note; the crested"
"214"	"     lark sends up its song toward heaven, and the grave and stately"
"215"	"     stork inspires the mind with thought, and leads it on to meditation"
"216"	"     and repose.  Life here was once idyllic, charming; here were once no"
"217"	"     rich, no poor, no high, no low.  It was a world of ease, simplicity,"
"218"	"     and beauty; now it is a scene of desolation and misery.”"
"219"	"This is not an ingenious picture.  It is the worst I ever saw.  It"
"220"	"describes in elaborate detail what it terms a “terrestrial paradise,” and"
"221"	"closes with the startling information that this paradise is “a scene of"
"222"	"desolation and misery.”"
"223"	"I have given two fair, average specimens of the character of the"
"224"	"testimony offered by the majority of the writers who visit this region."
"225"	"One says, “Of the beauty of the scene I can not say enough,” and then"
"226"	"proceeds to cover up with a woof of glittering sentences a thing which,"
"227"	"when stripped for inspection, proves to be only an unobtrusive basin of"
"228"	"water, some mountainous desolation, and one tree.  The other, after a"
"229"	"conscientious effort to build a terrestrial paradise out of the same"
"230"	"materials, with the addition of a “grave and stately stork,” spoils it"
"231"	"all by blundering upon the ghastly truth at the last."
"232"	"Nearly every book concerning Galilee and its lake describes the scenery"
"233"	"as beautiful.  No--not always so straightforward as that.  Sometimes the"
"234"	"impression intentionally conveyed is that it is beautiful, at the same"
"235"	"time that the author is careful not to say that it is, in plain Saxon."
"236"	"But a careful analysis of these descriptions will show that the materials"
"237"	"of which they are formed are not individually beautiful and can not be"
"238"	"wrought into combinations that are beautiful.  The veneration and the"
"239"	"affection which some of these men felt for the scenes they were speaking"
"240"	"of, heated their fancies and biased their judgment; but the pleasant"
"241"	"falsities they wrote were full of honest sincerity, at any rate.  Others"
"242"	"wrote as they did, because they feared it would be unpopular to write"
"243"	"otherwise.  Others were hypocrites and deliberately meant to deceive."
"244"	"Any of them would say in a moment, if asked, that it was always right and"
"245"	"always best to tell the truth.  They would say that, at any rate, if they"
"246"	"did not perceive the drift of the question."
"247"	"But why should not the truth be spoken of this region?  Is the truth"
"248"	"harmful?  Has it ever needed to hide its face?  God made the Sea of"
"249"	"Galilee and its surroundings as they are.  Is it the province of Mr."
"250"	"Grimes to improve upon the work?"
"251"	"I am sure, from the tenor of books I have read, that many who have"
"252"	"visited this land in years gone by, were Presbyterians, and came seeking"
"253"	"evidences in support of their particular creed; they found a Presbyterian"
"254"	"Palestine, and they had already made up their minds to find no other,"
"255"	"though possibly they did not know it, being blinded by their zeal."
"256"	"Others were Baptists, seeking Baptist evidences and a Baptist Palestine."
"257"	"Others were Catholics, Methodists, Episcopalians, seeking evidences"
"258"	"indorsing their several creeds, and a Catholic, a Methodist, an"
"259"	"Episcopalian Palestine.  Honest as these men’s intentions may have been,"
"260"	"they were full of partialities and prejudices, they entered the country"
"261"	"with their verdicts already prepared, and they could no more write"
"262"	"dispassionately and impartially about it than they could about their own"
"263"	"wives and children.  Our pilgrims have brought their verdicts with them."
"264"	"They have shown it in their conversation ever since we left Beirout."
"265"	"I can almost tell, in set phrase, what they will say when they see Tabor,"
"266"	"Nazareth, Jericho and Jerusalem--because I have the books they will"
"267"	"“smouch” their ideas from.  These authors write pictures and frame"
"268"	"rhapsodies, and lesser men follow and see with the author’s eyes instead"
"269"	"of their own, and speak with his tongue.  What the pilgrims said at"
"270"	"Cesarea Philippi surprised me with its wisdom.  I found it afterwards in"
"271"	"Robinson.  What they said when Genessaret burst upon their vision,"
"272"	"charmed me with its grace.  I find it in Mr. Thompson’s “Land and the"
"273"	"Book.”  They have spoken often, in happily worded language which never"
"274"	"varied, of how they mean to lay their weary heads upon a stone at Bethel,"
"275"	"as Jacob did, and close their dim eyes, and dream, perchance, of angels"
"276"	"descending out of heaven on a ladder.  It was very pretty.  But I have"
"277"	"recognized the weary head and the dim eyes, finally.  They borrowed the"
"278"	"idea--and the words--and the construction--and the punctuation--from"
"279"	"Grimes.  The pilgrims will tell of Palestine, when they get home, not as"
"280"	"it appeared to them, but as it appeared to Thompson and Robinson and"
"281"	"Grimes--with the tints varied to suit each pilgrim’s creed."
"282"	"Pilgrims, sinners and Arabs are all abed, now, and the camp is still."
"283"	"Labor in loneliness is irksome.  Since I made my last few notes, I have"
"284"	"been sitting outside the tent for half an hour.  Night is the time to see"
"285"	"Galilee.  Genessaret under these lustrous stars has nothing repulsive"
"286"	"about it.  Genessaret with the glittering reflections of the"
"287"	"constellations flecking its surface, almost makes me regret that I ever"
"288"	"saw the rude glare of the day upon it.  Its history and its associations"
"289"	"are its chiefest charm, in any eyes, and the spells they weave are feeble"
"290"	"in the searching light of the sun.  Then, we scarcely feel the fetters."
"291"	"Our thoughts wander constantly to the practical concerns of life, and"
"292"	"refuse to dwell upon things that seem vague and unreal.  But when the day"
"293"	"is done, even the most unimpressible must yield to the dreamy influences"
"294"	"of this tranquil starlight.  The old traditions of the place steal upon"
"295"	"his memory and haunt his reveries, and then his fancy clothes all sights"
"296"	"and sounds with the supernatural.  In the lapping of the waves upon the"
"297"	"beach, he hears the dip of ghostly oars; in the secret noises of the"
"298"	"night he hears spirit voices; in the soft sweep of the breeze, the rush"
"299"	"of invisible wings.  Phantom ships are on the sea, the dead of twenty"
"300"	"centuries come forth from the tombs, and in the dirges of the night wind"
"301"	"the songs of old forgotten ages find utterance again."
"302"	"In the starlight, Galilee has no boundaries but the broad compass of the"
"303"	"heavens, and is a theatre meet for great events; meet for the birth of a"
"304"	"religion able to save a world; and meet for the stately Figure appointed"
"305"	"to stand upon its stage and proclaim its high decrees.  But in the"
"306"	"sunlight, one says: Is it for the deeds which were done and the words"
"307"	"which were spoken in this little acre of rocks and sand eighteen"
"308"	"centuries gone, that the bells are ringing to-day in the remote islands"
"309"	"of the sea and far and wide over continents that clasp the circumference"
"310"	"of the huge globe?"
"311"	"One can comprehend it only when night has hidden all incongruities and"
"312"	"created a theatre proper for so grand a drama."
"313"	"CHAPTER XLIX."
