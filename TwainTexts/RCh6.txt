"1"	"CHAPTER VI."
"2"	"Our new conductor (just shipped) had been without sleep for twenty hours."
"3"	"Such a thing was very frequent.  From St. Joseph, Missouri, to"
"4"	"Sacramento, California, by stage-coach, was nearly nineteen hundred"
"5"	"miles, and the trip was often made in fifteen days (the cars do it in"
"6"	"four and a half, now), but the time specified in the mail contracts, and"
"7"	"required by the schedule, was eighteen or nineteen days, if I remember"
"8"	"rightly.  This was to make fair allowance for winter storms and snows,"
"9"	"and other unavoidable causes of detention.  The stage company had"
"10"	"everything under strict discipline and good system.  Over each two"
"11"	"hundred and fifty miles of road they placed an agent or superintendent,"
"12"	"and invested him with great authority.  His beat or jurisdiction of two"
"13"	"hundred and fifty miles was called a “division.” He purchased horses,"
"14"	"mules harness, and food for men and beasts, and distributed these things"
"15"	"among his stage stations, from time to time, according to his judgment of"
"16"	"what each station needed.  He erected station buildings and dug wells."
"17"	"He attended to the paying of the station-keepers, hostlers, drivers and"
"18"	"blacksmiths, and discharged them whenever he chose.  He was a very, very"
"19"	"great man in his “division”--a kind of Grand Mogul, a Sultan of the"
"20"	"Indies, in whose presence common men were modest of speech and manner,"
"21"	"and in the glare of whose greatness even the dazzling stage-driver"
"22"	"dwindled to a penny dip.  There were about eight of these kings, all"
"23"	"told, on the overland route."
"24"	"Next in rank and importance to the division-agent came the “conductor.”"
"25"	" His beat was the same length as the agent’s--two hundred and fifty miles."
"26"	"He sat with the driver, and (when necessary) rode that fearful distance,"
"27"	"night and day, without other rest or sleep than what he could get perched"
"28"	"thus on top of the flying vehicle.  Think of it!  He had absolute charge"
"29"	"of the mails, express matter, passengers and stage, coach, until he"
"30"	"delivered them to the next conductor, and got his receipt for them."
"31"	"Consequently he had to be a man of intelligence, decision and"
"32"	"considerable executive ability.  He was usually a quiet, pleasant man,"
"33"	"who attended closely to his duties, and was a good deal of a gentleman."
"34"	"It was not absolutely necessary that the division-agent should be a"
"35"	"gentleman, and occasionally he wasn’t.  But he was always a general in"
"36"	"administrative ability, and a bull-dog in courage and determination"
"37"	"--otherwise the chieftainship over the lawless underlings of the overland"
"38"	"service would never in any instance have been to him anything but an"
"39"	"equivalent for a month of insolence and distress and a bullet and a"
"40"	"coffin at the end of it.  There were about sixteen or eighteen conductors"
"41"	"on the overland, for there was a daily stage each way, and a conductor on"
"42"	"every stage."
"43"	"Next in real and official rank and importance, after the conductor, came"
"44"	"my delight, the driver--next in real but not in apparent importance--for"
"45"	"we have seen that in the eyes of the common herd the driver was to the"
"46"	"conductor as an admiral is to the captain of the flag-ship.  The driver’s"
"47"	"beat was pretty long, and his sleeping-time at the stations pretty short,"
"48"	"sometimes; and so, but for the grandeur of his position his would have"
"49"	"been a sorry life, as well as a hard and a wearing one.  We took a new"
"50"	"driver every day or every night (for they drove backward and forward over"
"51"	"the same piece of road all the time), and therefore we never got as well"
"52"	"acquainted with them as we did with the conductors; and besides, they"
"53"	"would have been above being familiar with such rubbish as passengers,"
"54"	"anyhow, as a general thing.  Still, we were always eager to get a sight"
"55"	"of each and every new driver as soon as the watch changed, for each and"
"56"	"every day we were either anxious to get rid of an unpleasant one, or"
"57"	"loath to part with a driver we had learned to like and had come to be"
"58"	"sociable and friendly with.  And so the first question we asked the"
"59"	"conductor whenever we got to where we were to exchange drivers, was"
"60"	"always, “Which is him?”  The grammar was faulty, maybe, but we could not"
"61"	"know, then, that it would go into a book some day.  As long as everything"
"62"	"went smoothly, the overland driver was well enough situated, but if a"
"63"	"fellow driver got sick suddenly it made trouble, for the coach must go"
"64"	"on, and so the potentate who was about to climb down and take a luxurious"
"65"	"rest after his long night’s siege in the midst of wind and rain and"
"66"	"darkness, had to stay where he was and do the sick man’s work.  Once, in"
"67"	"the Rocky Mountains, when I found a driver sound asleep on the box, and"
"68"	"the mules going at the usual break-neck pace, the conductor said never"
"69"	"mind him, there was no danger, and he was doing double duty--had driven"
"70"	"seventy-five miles on one coach, and was now going back over it on this"
"71"	"without rest or sleep.  A hundred and fifty miles of holding back of six"
"72"	"vindictive mules and keeping them from climbing the trees!  It sounds"
"73"	"incredible, but I remember the statement well enough."
"74"	"The station-keepers, hostlers, etc., were low, rough characters, as"
"75"	"already described; and from western Nebraska to Nevada a considerable"
"76"	"sprinkling of them might be fairly set down as outlaws--fugitives from"
"77"	"justice, criminals whose best security was a section of country which was"
"78"	"without law and without even the pretence of it.  When the"
"79"	"“division-agent” issued an order to one of these parties he did it with"
"80"	"the full understanding that he might have to enforce it with a navy"
"81"	"six-shooter, and so he always went “fixed” to make things go along"
"82"	"smoothly."
"83"	"Now and then a division-agent was really obliged to shoot a hostler"
"84"	"through the head to teach him some simple matter that he could have"
"85"	"taught him with a club if his circumstances and surroundings had been"
"86"	"different.  But they were snappy, able men, those division-agents, and"
"87"	"when they tried to teach a subordinate anything, that subordinate"
"88"	"generally “got it through his head.”"
"89"	"A great portion of this vast machinery--these hundreds of men and"
"90"	"coaches, and thousands of mules and horses--was in the hands of Mr. Ben"
"91"	"Holliday.  All the western half of the business was in his hands.  This"
"92"	"reminds me of an incident of Palestine travel which is pertinent here, so"
"93"	"I will transfer it just in the language in which I find it set down in my"
"94"	"Holy Land note-book:"
"95"	"      No doubt everybody has heard of Ben Holliday--a man of prodigious"
"96"	"      energy, who used to send mails and passengers flying across the"
"97"	"      continent in his overland stage-coaches like a very whirlwind--two"
"98"	"      thousand long miles in fifteen days and a half, by the watch!  But"
"99"	"      this fragment of history is not about Ben Holliday, but about a"
"100"	"      young New York boy by the name of Jack, who traveled with our small"
"101"	"      party of pilgrims in the Holy Land (and who had traveled to"
"102"	"      California in Mr. Holliday’s overland coaches three years before,"
"103"	"      and had by no means forgotten it or lost his gushing admiration of"
"104"	"      Mr. H.) Aged nineteen.  Jack was a good boy--a good-hearted and"
"105"	"      always well-meaning boy, who had been reared in the city of New"
"106"	"      York, and although he was bright and knew a great many useful"
"107"	"      things, his Scriptural education had been a good deal neglected--to"
"108"	"      such a degree, indeed, that all Holy Land history was fresh and new"
"109"	"      to him, and all Bible names mysteries that had never disturbed his"
"110"	"      virgin ear."
"111"	"      Also in our party was an elderly pilgrim who was the reverse of"
"112"	"      Jack, in that he was learned in the Scriptures and an enthusiast"
"113"	"      concerning them.  He was our encyclopedia, and we were never tired"
"114"	"      of listening to his speeches, nor he of making them.  He never"
"115"	"      passed a celebrated locality, from Bashan to Bethlehem, without"
"116"	"      illuminating it with an oration.  One day, when camped near the"
"117"	"      ruins of Jericho, he burst forth with something like this:"
"118"	"      “Jack, do you see that range of mountains over yonder that bounds"
"119"	"      the Jordan valley?  The mountains of Moab, Jack!  Think of it, my"
"120"	"      boy--the actual mountains of Moab--renowned in Scripture history!"
"121"	"      We are actually standing face to face with those illustrious crags"
"122"	"      and peaks--and for all we know” [dropping his voice impressively],"
"123"	"      “our eyes may be resting at this very moment upon the spot WHERE"
"124"	"      LIES THE MYSTERIOUS GRAVE OF MOSES!  Think of it, Jack!”"
"125"	"      “Moses who?”  (falling inflection)."
"126"	"      “Moses who!  Jack, you ought to be ashamed of yourself--you ought to"
"127"	"      be ashamed of such criminal ignorance.  Why, Moses, the great guide,"
"128"	"      soldier, poet, lawgiver of ancient Israel!  Jack, from this spot"
"129"	"      where we stand, to Egypt, stretches a fearful desert three hundred"
"130"	"      miles in extent--and across that desert that wonderful man brought"
"131"	"      the children of Israel!--guiding them with unfailing sagacity for"
"132"	"      forty years over the sandy desolation and among the obstructing"
"133"	"      rocks and hills, and landed them at last, safe and sound, within"
"134"	"      sight of this very spot; and where we now stand they entered the"
"135"	"      Promised Land with anthems of rejoicing!  It was a wonderful,"
"136"	"      wonderful thing to do, Jack!  Think of it!”"
"137"	"      “Forty years?  Only three hundred miles?  Humph!  Ben Holliday would"
"138"	"      have fetched them through in thirty-six hours!”"
"139"	"The boy meant no harm.  He did not know that he had said anything that"
"140"	"was wrong or irreverent.  And so no one scolded him or felt offended with"
"141"	"him--and nobody could but some ungenerous spirit incapable of excusing"
"142"	"the heedless blunders of a boy."
"143"	"At noon on the fifth day out, we arrived at the “Crossing of the South"
"144"	"Platte,” alias “Julesburg,” alias “Overland City,” four hundred and"
"145"	"seventy miles from St. Joseph--the strangest, quaintest, funniest"
"146"	"frontier town that our untraveled eyes had ever stared at and been"
"147"	"astonished with."
