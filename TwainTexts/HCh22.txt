"1"	"CHAPTER XXII."
"2"	"THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn’s house, a-whooping and raging like"
"3"	"Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped"
"4"	"to mush, and it was awful to see.  Children was heeling it ahead of the"
"5"	"mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along"
"6"	"the road was full of women’s heads, and there was nigger boys in every"
"7"	"tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the"
"8"	"mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of"
"9"	"reach.  Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared"
"10"	"most to death."
"11"	"They swarmed up in front of Sherburn’s palings as thick as they could"
"12"	"jam together, and you couldn’t hear yourself think for the noise.  It"
"13"	"was a little twenty-foot yard.  Some sung out “Tear down the fence! tear"
"14"	"down the fence!”  Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and"
"15"	"smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to"
"16"	"roll in like a wave."
"17"	"Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,"
"18"	"with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly"
"19"	"ca’m and deliberate, not saying a word.  The racket stopped, and the"
"20"	"wave sucked back."
"21"	"Sherburn never said a word--just stood there, looking down.  The"
"22"	"stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.  Sherburn run his eye slow"
"23"	"along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to"
"24"	"out-gaze him, but they couldn’t; they dropped their eyes and looked"
"25"	"sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant"
"26"	"kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread"
"27"	"that’s got sand in it."
"28"	"Then he says, slow and scornful:"
"29"	"“The idea of _you_ lynching anybody!  It’s amusing.  The idea of you"
"30"	"thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a _man_!  Because you’re brave"
"31"	"enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along"
"32"	"here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a"
"33"	"_man_?  Why, a _man’s_ safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind--as"
"34"	"long as it’s daytime and you’re not behind him."
"35"	"“Do I know you?  I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the"
"36"	"South, and I’ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around."
"37"	"The average man’s a coward.  In the North he lets anybody walk over him"
"38"	"that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it."
"39"	"In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men"
"40"	"in the daytime, and robbed the lot.  Your newspapers call you a"
"41"	"brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other"
"42"	"people--whereas you’re just _as_ brave, and no braver.  Why don’t your"
"43"	"juries hang murderers?  Because they’re afraid the man’s friends will"
"44"	"shoot them in the back, in the dark--and it’s just what they _would_ do."
"45"	"“So they always acquit; and then a _man_ goes in the night, with a"
"46"	"hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal.  Your mistake"
"47"	"is, that you didn’t bring a man with you; that’s one mistake, and the"
"48"	"other is that you didn’t come in the dark and fetch your masks.  You"
"49"	"brought _part_ of a man--Buck Harkness, there--and if you hadn’t had him"
"50"	"to start you, you’d a taken it out in blowing."
"51"	"“You didn’t want to come.  The average man don’t like trouble and"
"52"	"danger. _You_ don’t like trouble and danger.  But if only _half_ a"
"53"	"man--like Buck Harkness, there--shouts ‘Lynch him! lynch him!’ you’re"
"54"	"afraid to back down--afraid you’ll be found out to be what you"
"55"	"are--_cowards_--and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that"
"56"	"half-a-man’s coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big"
"57"	"things you’re going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that’s"
"58"	"what an army is--a mob; they don’t fight with courage that’s born in"
"59"	"them, but with courage that’s borrowed from their mass, and from their"
"60"	"officers.  But a mob without any _man_ at the head of it is _beneath_"
"61"	"pitifulness.  Now the thing for _you_ to do is to droop your tails and"
"62"	"go home and crawl in a hole.  If any real lynching’s going to be done it"
"63"	"will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they’ll"
"64"	"bring their masks, and fetch a _man_ along.  Now _leave_--and take your"
"65"	"half-a-man with you”--tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking"
"66"	"it when he says this."
"67"	"The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing"
"68"	"off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking"
"69"	"tolerable cheap.  I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn’t want to."
"70"	"I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman"
"71"	"went by, and then dived in under the tent.  I had my twenty-dollar gold"
"72"	"piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because"
"73"	"there ain’t no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from"
"74"	"home and amongst strangers that way.  You can’t be too careful.  I ain’t"
"75"	"opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain’t no other way, but"
"76"	"there ain’t no use in _wasting_ it on them."
"77"	"It was a real bully circus.  It was the splendidest sight that ever was"
"78"	"when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side"
"79"	"by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes"
"80"	"nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and"
"81"	"comfortable--there must a been twenty of them--and every lady with a"
"82"	"lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang"
"83"	"of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of"
"84"	"dollars, and just littered with diamonds.  It was a powerful fine sight;"
"85"	"I never see anything so lovely.  And then one by one they got up"
"86"	"and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and"
"87"	"graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their"
"88"	"heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and"
"89"	"every lady’s rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips,"
"90"	"and she looking like the most loveliest parasol."
"91"	"And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one"
"92"	"foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and"
"93"	"more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking"
"94"	"his whip and shouting “Hi!--hi!” and the clown cracking jokes behind"
"95"	"him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her"
"96"	"knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how"
"97"	"the horses did lean over and hump themselves!  And so one after the"
"98"	"other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I"
"99"	"ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and"
"100"	"went just about wild."
"101"	"Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and"
"102"	"all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people.  The"
"103"	"ringmaster couldn’t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick"
"104"	"as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever"
"105"	"_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I"
"106"	"couldn’t noway understand. Why, I couldn’t a thought of them in a year."
"107"	"And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to"
"108"	"ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was.  They argued"
"109"	"and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn’t listen, and the whole show"
"110"	"come to a standstill.  Then the people begun to holler at him and make"
"111"	"fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that"
"112"	"stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the"
"113"	"benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock him down! throw him"
"114"	"out!” and one or two women begun to scream.  So, then, the ringmaster"
"115"	"he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn’t be no"
"116"	"disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn’t make no more"
"117"	"trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse."
"118"	" So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute"
"119"	"he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,"
"120"	"with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the"
"121"	"drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every"
"122"	"jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing"
"123"	"till tears rolled down.  And at last, sure enough, all the circus men"
"124"	"could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,"
"125"	"round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging"
"126"	"to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,"
"127"	"and then t’other one on t’other side, and the people just crazy.  It"
"128"	"warn’t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger."
"129"	" But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,"
"130"	"a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and"
"131"	"dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire"
"132"	"too.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable"
"133"	"as if he warn’t ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his"
"134"	"clothes and sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up"
"135"	"the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he"
"136"	"was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you"
"137"	"ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly"
"138"	"hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to"
"139"	"the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and"
"140"	"astonishment."
"141"	"Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the"
"142"	"sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon.  Why, it was one of his own"
"143"	"men!  He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on"
"144"	"to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn’t"
"145"	"a been in that ringmaster’s place, not for a thousand dollars.  I don’t"
"146"	"know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I"
"147"	"never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for _me_; and"
"148"	"wherever I run across it, it can have all of _my_ custom every time."
"149"	"Well, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn’t only about twelve"
"150"	"people there--just enough to pay expenses.  And they laughed all the"
"151"	"time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before"
"152"	"the show was over, but one boy which was asleep.  So the duke said these"
"153"	"Arkansaw lunkheads couldn’t come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted"
"154"	"was low comedy--and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he"
"155"	"reckoned.  He said he could size their style.  So next morning he got"
"156"	"some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off"
"157"	"some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.  The bills said:"
"158"	"CHAPTER XXIII."
