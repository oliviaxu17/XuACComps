"1"	"CHAPTER LXVII."
"2"	"I still quote from my journal:"
"3"	"I found the national Legislature to consist of half a dozen white men and"
"4"	"some thirty or forty natives.  It was a dark assemblage.  The nobles and"
"5"	"Ministers (about a dozen of them altogether) occupied the extreme left of"
"6"	"the hall, with David Kalakaua (the King’s Chamberlain) and Prince William"
"7"	"at the head.  The President of the Assembly, His Royal Highness M."
"8"	"Kekuanaoa, [Kekuanaoa is not of the blood royal.  He derives his princely"
"9"	"rank from his wife, who was a daughter of Kamehameha the Great.  Under"
"10"	"other monarchies the male line takes precedence of the female in tracing"
"11"	"genealogies, but here the opposite is the case--the female line takes"
"12"	"precedence.  Their reason for this is exceedingly sensible, and I"
"13"	"recommend it to the aristocracy of Europe: They say it is easy to know"
"14"	"who a man’s mother was, but, etc., etc.] and the Vice President (the"
"15"	"latter a white man,) sat in the pulpit, if I may so term it."
"16"	"The President is the King’s father.  He is an erect, strongly built,"
"17"	"massive featured, white-haired, tawny old gentleman of eighty years of"
"18"	"age or thereabouts.  He was simply but well dressed, in a blue cloth coat"
"19"	"and white vest, and white pantaloons, without spot, dust or blemish upon"
"20"	"them.  He bears himself with a calm, stately dignity, and is a man of"
"21"	"noble presence.  He was a young man and a distinguished warrior under"
"22"	"that terrific fighter, Kamehameha I., more than half a century ago.  A"
"23"	"knowledge of his career suggested some such thought as this: “This man,"
"24"	"naked as the day he was born, and war-club and spear in hand, has charged"
"25"	"at the head of a horde of savages against other hordes of savages more"
"26"	"than a generation and a half ago, and reveled in slaughter and carnage;"
"27"	"has worshipped wooden images on his devout knees; has seen hundreds of"
"28"	"his race offered up in heathen temples as sacrifices to wooden idols, at"
"29"	"a time when no missionary’s foot had ever pressed this soil, and he had"
"30"	"never heard of the white man’s God; has believed his enemy could secretly"
"31"	"pray him to death; has seen the day, in his childhood, when it was a"
"32"	"crime punishable by death for a man to eat with his wife, or for a"
"33"	"plebeian to let his shadow fall upon the King--and now look at him; an"
"34"	"educated Christian; neatly and handsomely dressed; a high-minded, elegant"
"35"	"gentleman; a traveler, in some degree, and one who has been the honored"
"36"	"guest of royalty in Europe; a man practiced in holding the reins of an"
"37"	"enlightened government, and well versed in the politics of his country"
"38"	"and in general, practical information.  Look at him, sitting there"
"39"	"presiding over the deliberations of a legislative body, among whom are"
"40"	"white men--a grave, dignified, statesmanlike personage, and as seemingly"
"41"	"natural and fitted to the place as if he had been born in it and had"
"42"	"never been out of it in his life time.  How the experiences of this old"
"43"	"man’s eventful life shame the cheap inventions of romance!”"
"44"	"The christianizing of the natives has hardly even weakened some of their"
"45"	"barbarian superstitions, much less destroyed them.  I have just referred"
"46"	"to one of these.  It is still a popular belief that if your enemy can get"
"47"	"hold of any article belonging to you he can get down on his knees over it"
"48"	"and pray you to death.  Therefore many a native gives up and dies merely"
"49"	"because he imagines that some enemy is putting him through a course of"
"50"	"damaging prayer.  This praying an individual to death seems absurd enough"
"51"	"at a first glance, but then when we call to mind some of the pulpit"
"52"	"efforts of certain of our own ministers the thing looks plausible."
"53"	"In former times, among the Islanders, not only a plurality of wives was"
"54"	"customary, but a plurality of husbands likewise.  Some native women of"
"55"	"noble rank had as many as six husbands.  A woman thus supplied did not"
"56"	"reside with all her husbands at once, but lived several months with each"
"57"	"in turn.  An understood sign hung at her door during these months.  When"
"58"	"the sign was taken down, it meant “NEXT.”"
"59"	"In those days woman was rigidly taught to “know her place.”  Her place"
"60"	"was to do all the work, take all the cuffs, provide all the food, and"
"61"	"content herself with what was left after her lord had finished his"
"62"	"dinner.  She was not only forbidden, by ancient law, and under penalty of"
"63"	"death, to eat with her husband or enter a canoe, but was debarred, under"
"64"	"the same penalty, from eating bananas, pine-apples, oranges and other"
"65"	"choice fruits at any time or in any place.  She had to confine herself"
"66"	"pretty strictly to “poi” and hard work.  These poor ignorant heathen seem"
"67"	"to have had a sort of groping idea of what came of woman eating fruit in"
"68"	"the garden of Eden, and they did not choose to take any more chances."
"69"	"But the missionaries broke up this satisfactory arrangement of things."
"70"	"They liberated woman and made her the equal of man."
"71"	"The natives had a romantic fashion of burying some of their children"
"72"	"alive when the family became larger than necessary.  The missionaries"
"73"	"interfered in this matter too, and stopped it."
"74"	"To this day the natives are able to lie down and die whenever they want"
"75"	"to, whether there is anything the matter with them or not.  If a Kanaka"
"76"	"takes a notion to die, that is the end of him; nobody can persuade him to"
"77"	"hold on; all the doctors in the world could not save him."
"78"	"A luxury which they enjoy more than anything else, is a large funeral."
"79"	"If a person wants to get rid of a troublesome native, it is only"
"80"	"necessary to promise him a fine funeral and name the hour and he will be"
"81"	"on hand to the minute--at least his remains will."
"82"	"All the natives are Christians, now, but many of them still desert to the"
"83"	"Great Shark God for temporary succor in time of trouble.  An irruption of"
"84"	"the great volcano of Kilauea, or an earthquake, always brings a deal of"
"85"	"latent loyalty to the Great Shark God to the surface.  It is common"
"86"	"report that the King, educated, cultivated and refined Christian"
"87"	"gentleman as he undoubtedly is, still turns to the idols of his fathers"
"88"	"for help when disaster threatens.  A planter caught a shark, and one of"
"89"	"his christianized natives testified his emancipation from the thrall of"
"90"	"ancient superstition by assisting to dissect the shark after a fashion"
"91"	"forbidden by his abandoned creed.  But remorse shortly began to torture"
"92"	"him.  He grew moody and sought solitude; brooded over his sin, refused"
"93"	"food, and finally said he must die and ought to die, for he had sinned"
"94"	"against the Great Shark God and could never know peace any more.  He was"
"95"	"proof against persuasion and ridicule, and in the course of a day or two"
"96"	"took to his bed and died, although he showed no symptom of disease."
"97"	"His young daughter followed his lead and suffered a like fate within the"
"98"	"week.  Superstition is ingrained in the native blood and bone and it is"
"99"	"only natural that it should crop out in time of distress.  Wherever one"
"100"	"goes in the Islands, he will find small piles of stones by the wayside,"
"101"	"covered with leafy offerings, placed there by the natives to appease evil"
"102"	"spirits or honor local deities belonging to the mythology of former days."
"103"	"In the rural districts of any of the Islands, the traveler hourly comes"
"104"	"upon parties of dusky maidens bathing in the streams or in the sea"
"105"	"without any clothing on and exhibiting no very intemperate zeal in the"
"106"	"matter of hiding their nakedness.  When the missionaries first took up"
"107"	"their residence in Honolulu, the native women would pay their families"
"108"	"frequent friendly visits, day by day, not even clothed with a blush."
"109"	"It was found a hard matter to convince them that this was rather"
"110"	"indelicate.  Finally the missionaries provided them with long, loose"
"111"	"calico robes, and that ended the difficulty--for the women would troop"
"112"	"through the town, stark naked, with their robes folded under their arms,"
"113"	"march to the missionary houses and then  proceed to dress!--The natives"
"114"	"soon manifested a strong proclivity for clothing, but it was shortly"
"115"	"apparent that they only wanted it for grandeur.  The missionaries"
"116"	"imported a quantity of hats, bonnets, and other male and female wearing"
"117"	"apparel, instituted a general distribution, and begged the people not to"
"118"	"come to church naked, next Sunday, as usual.  And they did not; but the"
"119"	"national spirit of unselfishness led them to divide up with neighbors who"
"120"	"were not at the distribution, and next Sabbath the poor preachers could"
"121"	"hardly keep countenance before their vast congregations.  In the midst of"
"122"	"the reading of a hymn a brown, stately dame would sweep up the aisle with"
"123"	"a world of airs, with nothing in the world on but a “stovepipe” hat and a"
"124"	"pair of cheap gloves; another dame would follow, tricked out in a man’s"
"125"	"shirt, and nothing else; another one would enter with a flourish, with"
"126"	"simply the sleeves of a bright calico dress tied around her waist and the"
"127"	"rest of the garment dragging behind like a peacock’s tail off duty; a"
"128"	"stately “buck” Kanaka would stalk in with a woman’s bonnet on, wrong side"
"129"	"before--only this, and nothing more; after him would stride his fellow,"
"130"	"with the legs of a pair of pantaloons tied around his neck, the rest of"
"131"	"his person untrammeled; in his rear would come another gentleman simply"
"132"	"gotten up in a fiery neck-tie and a striped vest."
"133"	"The poor creatures were beaming with complacency and wholly unconscious"
"134"	"of any absurdity in their appearance.  They gazed at each other with"
"135"	"happy admiration, and it was plain to see that the young girls were"
"136"	"taking note of what each other had on, as naturally as if they had always"
"137"	"lived in a land of Bibles and knew what churches were made for; here was"
"138"	"the evidence of a dawning civilization.  The spectacle which the"
"139"	"congregation presented was so extraordinary and withal so moving, that"
"140"	"the missionaries found it difficult to keep to the text and go on with"
"141"	"the services; and by and by when the simple children of the sun began a"
"142"	"general swapping of garments in open meeting and produced some"
"143"	"irresistibly grotesque effects in the course of re-dressing, there was"
"144"	"nothing for it but to cut the thing short with the benediction and"
"145"	"dismiss the fantastic assemblage."
"146"	"In our country, children play “keep house;” and in the same high-sounding"
"147"	"but miniature way the grown folk here, with the poor little material of"
"148"	"slender territory and meagre population, play “empire.”  There is his"
"149"	"royal Majesty the King, with a New York detective’s income of thirty or"
"150"	"thirty-five thousand dollars a year from the “royal civil list” and the"
"151"	"“royal domain.”  He lives in a two-story frame “palace.”"
"152"	"And there is the “royal family”--the customary hive of royal brothers,"
"153"	"sisters, cousins and other noble drones and vagrants usual to monarchy,"
"154"	"--all with a spoon in the national pap-dish, and all bearing such titles as"
"155"	"his or her Royal Highness the Prince or Princess So-and-so.  Few of them"
"156"	"can carry their royal splendors far enough to ride in carriages, however;"
"157"	"they sport the economical Kanaka horse or “hoof it” with the plebeians."
"158"	"Then there is his Excellency the “royal Chamberlain”--a sinecure, for his"
"159"	"majesty dresses himself with his own hands, except when he is ruralizing"
"160"	"at Waikiki and then he requires no dressing."
"161"	"Next we have his Excellency the Commander-in-chief of the Household"
"162"	"Troops, whose forces consist of about the number of soldiers usually"
"163"	"placed under a corporal in other lands."
"164"	"Next comes the royal Steward and the Grand Equerry in Waiting--high"
"165"	"dignitaries with modest salaries and little to do."
"166"	"Then we have his Excellency the First Gentleman of the Bed-chamber--an"
"167"	"office as easy as it is magnificent."
"168"	"Next we come to his Excellency the Prime Minister, a renegade American"
"169"	"from New Hampshire, all jaw, vanity, bombast and ignorance, a lawyer of"
"170"	"“shyster” calibre, a fraud by nature, a humble worshipper of the sceptre"
"171"	"above him, a reptile never tired of sneering at the land of his birth or"
"172"	"glorifying the ten-acre kingdom that has adopted him--salary, $4,000 a"
"173"	"year, vast consequence, and no perquisites."
"174"	"Then we have his Excellency the Imperial Minister of Finance, who handles"
"175"	"a million dollars of public money a year, sends in his annual “budget”"
"176"	" with great ceremony, talks prodigiously of “finance,” suggests imposing"
"177"	"schemes for paying off the “national debt” (of $150,000,) and does it all"
"178"	"for $4,000 a year and unimaginable glory."
"179"	"Next we have his Excellency the Minister of War, who holds sway over the"
"180"	"royal armies--they consist of two hundred and thirty uniformed Kanakas,"
"181"	"mostly Brigadier Generals, and if the country ever gets into trouble with"
"182"	"a foreign power we shall probably hear from them.  I knew an American"
"183"	"whose copper-plate visiting card bore this impressive legend:"
"184"	"“Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Infantry.”  To say that he was proud of"
"185"	"this distinction is stating it but tamely.  The Minister of War has also"
"186"	"in his charge some venerable swivels on Punch-Bowl Hill wherewith royal"
"187"	"salutes are fired when foreign vessels of war enter the port."
"188"	"Next comes his Excellency the Minister of the Navy--a nabob who rules the"
"189"	"“royal fleet,” (a steam-tug and a sixty-ton schooner.)"
"190"	"And next comes his Grace the Lord Bishop of Honolulu, the chief dignitary"
"191"	"of the “Established Church”--for when the American Presbyterian"
"192"	"missionaries had completed the reduction of the nation to a compact"
"193"	"condition of Christianity, native royalty stepped in and erected the"
"194"	"grand dignity of an “Established (Episcopal) Church” over it, and"
"195"	"imported a cheap ready-made Bishop from England to take charge.  The"
"196"	"chagrin of the missionaries has never been comprehensively expressed, to"
"197"	"this day, profanity not being admissible."
"198"	"Next comes his Excellency the Minister of Public Instruction."
"199"	"Next, their Excellencies the Governors of Oahu, Hawaii, etc., and after"
"200"	"them a string of High Sheriffs and other small fry too numerous for"
"201"	"computation."
"202"	"Then there are their Excellencies the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister"
"203"	"Plenipotentiary of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French; her"
"204"	"British Majesty’s Minister; the Minister Resident, of the United States;"
"205"	"and some six or eight representatives of other foreign nations, all with"
"206"	"sounding titles, imposing dignity and prodigious but economical state."
"207"	"Imagine all this grandeur in a play-house “kingdom” whose population"
"208"	"falls absolutely short of sixty thousand souls!"
"209"	"The people are so accustomed to nine-jointed titles and colossal magnates"
"210"	"that a foreign prince makes very little more stir in Honolulu than a"
"211"	"Western Congressman does in New York."
"212"	"And let it be borne in mind that there is a strictly defined “court"
"213"	"costume” of so “stunning” a nature that it would make the clown in a"
"214"	"circus look tame and commonplace by comparison; and each Hawaiian"
"215"	"official dignitary has a gorgeous vari-colored, gold-laced uniform"
"216"	"peculiar to his office--no two of them are alike, and it is hard to tell"
"217"	"which one is the “loudest.”  The King had a “drawing-room” at stated"
"218"	"intervals, like other monarchs, and when these varied uniforms congregate"
"219"	"there--weak-eyed people have to contemplate the spectacle through smoked"
"220"	"glass.  Is there not a gratifying contrast between this latter-day"
"221"	"exhibition and the one the ancestors of some of these magnates afforded"
"222"	"the missionaries the Sunday after the old-time distribution of clothing?"
"223"	"Behold what religion and civilization have wrought!"
"224"	"CHAPTER LXVIII."
