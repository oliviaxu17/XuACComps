"2"	"WHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,"
"3"	"and says:"
"4"	"“Tryin’ to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!  Tired of our company,"
"5"	"hey?”"
"6"	"I says:"
"7"	"“No, your majesty, we warn’t--_please_ don’t, your majesty!”"
"8"	"“Quick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I’ll shake the"
"9"	"insides out o’ you!”"
"10"	"“Honest, I’ll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty."
"11"	" The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he"
"12"	"had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry"
"13"	"to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by"
"14"	"surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go"
"15"	"of me and whispers, ‘Heel it now, or they’ll hang ye, sure!’ and I lit"
"16"	"out.  It didn’t seem no good for _me_ to stay--I couldn’t do nothing,"
"17"	"and I didn’t want to be hung if I could get away.  So I never stopped"
"18"	"running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry,"
"19"	"or they’d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the"
"20"	"duke wasn’t alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was"
"21"	"awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn’t.”"
"22"	"Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, “Oh,"
"23"	"yes, it’s _mighty_ likely!” and shook me up again, and said he reckoned"
"24"	"he’d drownd me.  But the duke says:"
"25"	"“Leggo the boy, you old idiot!  Would _you_ a done any different?  Did"
"26"	"you inquire around for _him_ when you got loose?  I don’t remember it.”"
"27"	"So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in"
"28"	"it. But the duke says:"
"29"	"“You better a blame’ sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you’re"
"30"	"the one that’s entitled to it most.  You hain’t done a thing from the"
"31"	"start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky"
"32"	"with that imaginary blue-arrow mark.  That _was_ bright--it was right"
"33"	"down bully; and it was the thing that saved us.  For if it hadn’t been"
"34"	"for that they’d a jailed us till them Englishmen’s baggage come--and"
"35"	"then--the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took ‘em to the"
"36"	"graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the"
"37"	"excited fools hadn’t let go all holts and made that rush to get a"
"38"	"look we’d a slept in our cravats to-night--cravats warranted to _wear_,"
"39"	"too--longer than _we’d_ need ‘em.”"
"40"	"They was still a minute--thinking; then the king says, kind of"
"41"	"absent-minded like:"
"42"	"“Mf!  And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!”"
"43"	"That made me squirm!"
"44"	"“Yes,” says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, “_we_"
"45"	"did.”"
"46"	"After about a half a minute the king drawls out:"
"47"	"“Leastways, I did.”"
"48"	"The duke says, the same way:"
"49"	"“On the contrary, I did.”"
"50"	"The king kind of ruffles up, and says:"
"51"	"“Looky here, Bilgewater, what’r you referrin’ to?”"
"52"	"The duke says, pretty brisk:"
"53"	"“When it comes to that, maybe you’ll let me ask, what was _you_"
"54"	"referring to?”"
"55"	"“Shucks!” says the king, very sarcastic; “but I don’t know--maybe you was"
"56"	"asleep, and didn’t know what you was about.”"
"57"	"The duke bristles up now, and says:"
"58"	"“Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame’ fool?"
"59"	"Don’t you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?”"
"60"	"“_Yes_, sir!  I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!”"
"61"	"“It’s a lie!”--and the duke went for him.  The king sings out:"
"62"	"“Take y’r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!”"
"63"	"The duke says:"
"64"	"“Well, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there,"
"65"	"intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig"
"66"	"it up, and have it all to yourself.”"
"67"	"“Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair;"
"68"	"if you didn’t put the money there, say it, and I’ll b’lieve you, and"
"69"	"take back everything I said.”"
"70"	"“You old scoundrel, I didn’t, and you know I didn’t.  There, now!”"
"71"	"“Well, then, I b’lieve you.  But answer me only jest this one more--now"
"72"	"_don’t_ git mad; didn’t you have it in your mind to hook the money and"
"73"	"hide it?”"
"74"	"The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:"
"75"	"“Well, I don’t care if I _did_, I didn’t _do_ it, anyway.  But you not"
"76"	"only had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.”"
"77"	"“I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that’s honest.  I won’t say"
"78"	"I warn’t goin’ to do it, because I _was_; but you--I mean somebody--got in"
"79"	"ahead o’ me.”"
"80"	"“It’s a lie!  You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or--”"
"81"	"The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:"
"82"	"“‘Nough!--I _own up!_”"
"83"	"I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier"
"84"	"than what I was feeling before.  So the duke took his hands off and"
"85"	"says:"
"86"	"“If you ever deny it again I’ll drown you.  It’s _well_ for you to set"
"87"	"there and blubber like a baby--it’s fitten for you, after the way"
"88"	"you’ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble"
"89"	"everything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own"
"90"	"father.  You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it"
"91"	"saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for ‘em."
"92"	" It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_"
"93"	"that rubbage.  Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make"
"94"	"up the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I’d got out of the Nonesuch"
"95"	"and one thing or another, and scoop it _all_!”"
"96"	"The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:"
"97"	"“Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn’t me.”"
"98"	"“Dry up!  I don’t want to hear no more out of you!” says the duke.  “And"
"99"	"_now_ you see what you GOT by it.  They’ve got all their own money back,"
"100"	"and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_.  G’long to bed, and"
"101"	"don’t you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long ‘s _you_ live!”"
"102"	"So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,"
"103"	"and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an"
"104"	"hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the"
"105"	"lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other’s arms.  They"
"106"	"both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn’t get mellow"
"107"	"enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag"
"108"	"again.  That made me feel easy and satisfied.  Of course when they got"
"109"	"to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything."
