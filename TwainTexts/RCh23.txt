"1"	"CHAPTER XXIII."
"2"	"If there is any life that is happier than the life we led on our timber"
"3"	"ranch for the next two or three weeks, it must be a sort of life which I"
"4"	"have not read of in books or experienced in person.  We did not see a"
"5"	"human being but ourselves during the time, or hear any sounds but those"
"6"	"that were made by the wind and the waves, the sighing of the pines, and"
"7"	"now and then the far-off thunder of an avalanche.  The forest about us"
"8"	"was dense and cool, the sky above us was cloudless and brilliant with"
"9"	"sunshine, the broad lake before us was glassy and clear, or rippled and"
"10"	"breezy, or black and storm-tossed, according to Nature’s mood; and its"
"11"	"circling border of mountain domes, clothed with forests, scarred with"
"12"	"land-slides, cloven by canons and valleys, and helmeted with glittering"
"13"	"snow, fitly framed and finished the noble picture.  The view was always"
"14"	"fascinating, bewitching, entrancing.  The eye was never tired of gazing,"
"15"	"night or day, in calm or storm; it suffered but one grief, and that was"
"16"	"that it could not look always, but must close sometimes in sleep."
"17"	"We slept in the sand close to the water’s edge, between two protecting"
"18"	"boulders, which took care of the stormy night-winds for us.  We never"
"19"	"took any paregoric to make us sleep.  At the first break of dawn we were"
"20"	"always up and running foot-races to tone down excess of physical vigor"
"21"	"and exuberance of spirits.  That is, Johnny was--but I held his hat."
"22"	"While smoking the pipe of peace after breakfast we watched the sentinel"
"23"	"peaks put on the glory of the sun, and followed the conquering light as"
"24"	"it swept down among the shadows, and set the captive crags and forests"
"25"	"free.  We watched the tinted pictures grow and brighten upon the water"
"26"	"till every little detail of forest, precipice and pinnacle was wrought in"
"27"	"and finished, and the miracle of the enchanter complete.  Then to"
"28"	"“business.”"
"29"	"That is, drifting around in the boat.  We were on the north shore."
"30"	"There, the rocks on the bottom are sometimes gray, sometimes white."
"31"	"This gives the marvelous transparency of the water a fuller advantage"
"32"	"than it has elsewhere on the lake.  We usually pushed out a hundred yards"
"33"	"or so from shore, and then lay down on the thwarts, in the sun, and let"
"34"	"the boat drift by the hour whither it would.  We seldom talked."
"35"	"It interrupted the Sabbath stillness, and marred the dreams the luxurious"
"36"	"rest and indolence brought.  The shore all along was indented with deep,"
"37"	"curved bays and coves, bordered by narrow sand-beaches; and where the"
"38"	"sand ended, the steep mountain-sides rose right up aloft into space--rose"
"39"	"up like a vast wall a little out of the perpendicular, and thickly wooded"
"40"	"with tall pines."
"41"	"So singularly clear was the water, that where it was only twenty or"
"42"	"thirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct that the boat"
"43"	"seemed floating in the air!  Yes, where it was even eighty feet deep."
"44"	"Every little pebble was distinct, every speckled trout, every"
"45"	"hand’s-breadth of sand.  Often, as we lay on our faces, a granite"
"46"	"boulder, as large as a village church, would start out of the bottom"
"47"	"apparently, and seem climbing up rapidly to the surface, till presently"
"48"	"it threatened to touch our faces, and we could not resist the impulse to"
"49"	"seize an oar and avert the danger.  But the boat would float on, and the"
"50"	"boulder descend again, and then we could see that when we had been"
"51"	"exactly above it, it must still have been twenty or thirty feet below the"
"52"	"surface.  Down through the transparency of these great depths, the water"
"53"	"was not merely transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so.  All objects"
"54"	"seen through it had a bright, strong vividness, not only of outline, but"
"55"	"of every minute detail, which they would not have had when seen simply"
"56"	"through the same depth of atmosphere.  So empty and airy did all spaces"
"57"	"seem below us, and so strong was the sense of floating high aloft in"
"58"	"mid-nothingness, that we called these boat-excursions “balloon-voyages.”"
"59"	"We fished a good deal, but we did not average one fish a week.  We could"
"60"	"see trout by the thousand winging about in the emptiness under us, or"
"61"	"sleeping in shoals on the bottom, but they would not bite--they could see"
"62"	"the line too plainly, perhaps.  We frequently selected the trout we"
"63"	"wanted, and rested the bait patiently and persistently on the end of his"
"64"	"nose at a depth of eighty feet, but he would only shake it off with an"
"65"	"annoyed manner, and shift his position."
"66"	"We bathed occasionally, but the water was rather chilly, for all it"
"67"	"looked so sunny.  Sometimes we rowed out to the “blue water,” a mile or"
"68"	"two from shore.  It was as dead blue as indigo there, because of the"
"69"	"immense depth.  By official measurement the lake in its centre is one"
"70"	"thousand five hundred and twenty-five feet deep!"
"71"	"Sometimes, on lazy afternoons, we lolled on the sand in camp, and smoked"
"72"	"pipes and read some old well-worn novels.  At night, by the camp-fire, we"
"73"	"played euchre and seven-up to strengthen the mind--and played them with"
"74"	"cards so greasy and defaced that only a whole summer’s acquaintance with"
"75"	"them could enable the student to tell the ace of clubs from the jack of"
"76"	"diamonds."
"77"	"We never slept in our “house.”  It never recurred to us, for one thing;"
"78"	"and besides, it was built to hold the ground, and that was enough.  We"
"79"	"did not wish to strain it."
"80"	"By and by our provisions began to run short, and we went back to the old"
"81"	"camp and laid in a new supply.  We were gone all day, and reached home"
"82"	"again about night-fall, pretty tired and hungry.  While Johnny was"
"83"	"carrying the main bulk of the provisions up to our “house” for future"
"84"	"use, I took the loaf of bread, some slices of bacon, and the coffee-pot,"
"85"	"ashore, set them down by a tree, lit a fire, and went back to the boat to"
"86"	"get the frying-pan.  While I was at this, I heard a shout from Johnny,"
"87"	"and looking up I saw that my fire was galloping all over the premises!"
"88"	"Johnny was on the other side of it.  He had to run through the flames to"
"89"	"get to the lake shore, and then we stood helpless and watched the"
"90"	"devastation."
"91"	"The ground was deeply carpeted with dry pine-needles, and the fire"
"92"	"touched them off as if they were gunpowder.  It was wonderful to see with"
"93"	"what fierce speed the tall sheet of flame traveled!  My coffee-pot was"
"94"	"gone, and everything with it.  In a minute and a half the fire seized"
"95"	"upon a dense growth of dry manzanita chapparal six or eight feet high,"
"96"	"and then the roaring and popping and crackling was something terrific."
"97"	"We were driven to the boat by the intense heat, and there we remained,"
"98"	"spell-bound."
"99"	"Within half an hour all before us was a tossing, blinding tempest of"
"100"	"flame!  It went surging up adjacent ridges--surmounted them and"
"101"	"disappeared in the canons beyond--burst into view upon higher and farther"
"102"	"ridges, presently--shed a grander illumination abroad, and dove again"
"103"	"--flamed out again, directly, higher and still higher up the"
"104"	"mountain-side--threw out skirmishing parties of fire here and there, and"
"105"	"sent them trailing their crimson spirals away among remote ramparts and"
"106"	"ribs and gorges, till as far as the eye could reach the lofty"
"107"	"mountain-fronts were webbed as it were with a tangled network of red lava"
"108"	"streams. Away across the water the crags and domes were lit with a ruddy"
"109"	"glare, and the firmament above was a reflected hell!"
"110"	"Every feature of the spectacle was repeated in the glowing mirror of the"
"111"	"lake!  Both pictures were sublime, both were beautiful; but that in the"
"112"	"lake had a bewildering richness about it that enchanted the eye and held"
"113"	"it with the stronger fascination."
"114"	"We sat absorbed and motionless through four long hours.  We never thought"
"115"	"of supper, and never felt fatigue.  But at eleven o’clock the"
"116"	"conflagration had traveled beyond our range of vision, and then darkness"
"117"	"stole down upon the landscape again."
"118"	"Hunger asserted itself now, but there was nothing to eat.  The provisions"
"119"	"were all cooked, no doubt, but we did not go to see.  We were homeless"
"120"	"wanderers again, without any property.  Our fence was gone, our house"
"121"	"burned down; no insurance.  Our pine forest was well scorched, the dead"
"122"	"trees all burned up, and our broad acres of manzanita swept away.  Our"
"123"	"blankets were on our usual sand-bed, however, and so we lay down and went"
"124"	"to sleep.  The next morning we started back to the old camp, but while"
"125"	"out a long way from shore, so great a storm came up that we dared not try"
"126"	"to land.  So I baled out the seas we shipped, and Johnny pulled heavily"
"127"	"through the billows till we had reached a point three or four miles"
"128"	"beyond the camp.  The storm was increasing, and it became evident that it"
"129"	"was better to take the hazard of beaching the boat than go down in a"
"130"	"hundred fathoms of water; so we ran in, with tall white-caps following,"
"131"	"and I sat down in the stern-sheets and pointed her head-on to the shore."
"132"	"The instant the bow struck, a wave came over the stern that washed crew"
"133"	"and cargo ashore, and saved a deal of trouble.  We shivered in the lee of"
"134"	"a boulder all the rest of the day, and froze all the night through.  In"
"135"	"the morning the tempest had gone down, and we paddled down to the camp"
"136"	"without any unnecessary delay.  We were so starved that we ate up the"
"137"	"rest of the Brigade’s provisions, and then set out to Carson to tell them"
"138"	"about it and ask their forgiveness.  It was accorded, upon payment of"
"139"	"damages."
"140"	"We made many trips to the lake after that, and had many a hair-breadth"
"141"	"escape and blood-curdling adventure which will never be recorded in any"
"142"	"history."
"143"	"CHAPTER XXIV."
