"1"	"CHAPTER XL."
"2"	"This has been a stirring day.  The Superintendent of the railway put a"
"3"	"train at our disposal, and did us the further kindness of accompanying us"
"4"	"to Ephesus and giving to us his watchful care.  We brought sixty scarcely"
"5"	"perceptible donkeys in the freight cars, for we had much ground to go"
"6"	"over.  We have seen some of the most grotesque costumes, along the line"
"7"	"of the railroad, that can be imagined.  I am glad that no possible"
"8"	"combination of words could describe them, for I might then be foolish"
"9"	"enough to attempt it."
"10"	"At ancient Ayassalook, in the midst of a forbidding desert, we came upon"
"11"	"long lines of ruined aqueducts, and other remnants of architectural"
"12"	"grandeur, that told us plainly enough we were nearing what had been a"
"13"	"metropolis, once.  We left the train and mounted the donkeys, along with"
"14"	"our invited guests--pleasant young gentlemen from the officers’ list of"
"15"	"an American man-of-war."
"16"	"The little donkeys had saddles upon them which were made very high in"
"17"	"order that the rider’s feet might not drag the ground.  The preventative"
"18"	"did not work well in the cases of our tallest pilgrims, however.  There"
"19"	"were no bridles--nothing but a single rope, tied to the bit.  It was"
"20"	"purely ornamental, for the donkey cared nothing for it.  If he were"
"21"	"drifting to starboard, you might put your helm down hard the other way,"
"22"	"if it were any satisfaction to you to do it, but he would continue to"
"23"	"drift to starboard all the same.  There was only one process which could"
"24"	"be depended on, and it was to get down and lift his rear around until his"
"25"	"head pointed in the right direction, or take him under your arm and carry"
"26"	"him to a part of the road which he could not get out of without climbing."
"27"	"The sun flamed down as hot as a furnace, and neck-scarfs, veils and"
"28"	"umbrellas seemed hardly any protection; they served only to make the long"
"29"	"procession look more than ever fantastic--for be it known the ladies were"
"30"	"all riding astride because they could not stay on the shapeless saddles"
"31"	"sidewise, the men were perspiring and out of temper, their feet were"
"32"	"banging against the rocks, the donkeys were capering in every direction"
"33"	"but the right one and being belabored with clubs for it, and every now"
"34"	"and then a broad umbrella would suddenly go down out of the cavalcade,"
"35"	"announcing to all that one more pilgrim had bitten the dust.  It was a"
"36"	"wilder picture than those solitudes had seen for many a day.  No donkeys"
"37"	"ever existed that were as hard to navigate as these, I think, or that had"
"38"	"so many vile, exasperating instincts.  Occasionally we grew so tired and"
"39"	"breathless with fighting them that we had to desist,--and immediately the"
"40"	"donkey would come down to a deliberate walk.  This, with the fatigue, and"
"41"	"the sun, would put a man asleep; and soon as the man was asleep, the"
"42"	"donkey would lie down.  My donkey shall never see his boyhood’s home"
"43"	"again.  He has lain down once too often. He must die."
"44"	"We all stood in the vast theatre of ancient Ephesus,--the stone-benched"
"45"	"amphitheatre I mean--and had our picture taken.  We looked as proper"
"46"	"there as we would look any where, I suppose.  We do not embellish the"
"47"	"general desolation of a desert much.  We add what dignity we can to a"
"48"	"stately ruin with our green umbrellas and jackasses, but it is little."
"49"	"However, we mean well."
"50"	"I wish to say a brief word of the aspect of Ephesus."
"51"	"On a high, steep hill, toward the sea, is a gray ruin of ponderous blocks"
"52"	"of marble, wherein, tradition says, St. Paul was imprisoned eighteen"
"53"	"centuries ago.  From these old walls you have the finest view of the"
"54"	"desolate scene where once stood Ephesus, the proudest city of ancient"
"55"	"times, and whose Temple of Diana was so noble in design, and so exquisite"
"56"	"of workmanship, that it ranked high in the list of the Seven Wonders of"
"57"	"the World."
"58"	"Behind you is the sea; in front is a level green valley, (a marsh, in"
"59"	"fact,) extending far away among the mountains; to the right of the front"
"60"	"view is the old citadel of Ayassalook, on a high hill; the ruined Mosque"
"61"	"of the Sultan Selim stands near it in the plain, (this is built over the"
"62"	"grave of St. John, and was formerly Christian Church); further toward"
"63"	"you is the hill of Pion, around whose front is clustered all that remains"
"64"	"of the ruins of Ephesus that still stand; divided from it by a narrow"
"65"	"valley is the long, rocky, rugged mountain of Coressus.  The scene is a"
"66"	"pretty one, and yet desolate--for in that wide plain no man can live, and"
"67"	"in it is no human habitation.  But for the crumbling arches and monstrous"
"68"	"piers and broken walls that rise from the foot of the hill of Pion, one"
"69"	"could not believe that in this place once stood a city whose renown is"
"70"	"older than tradition itself.  It is incredible to reflect that things as"
"71"	"familiar all over the world to-day as household words, belong in the"
"72"	"history and in the shadowy legends of this silent, mournful solitude."
"73"	"We speak of Apollo and of Diana--they were born here; of the"
"74"	"metamorphosis of Syrinx into a reed--it was done here; of the great god"
"75"	"Pan--he dwelt in the caves of this hill of Coressus; of the Amazons--this"
"76"	"was their best prized home; of Bacchus and Hercules both fought the"
"77"	"warlike women here; of the Cyclops--they laid the ponderous marble blocks"
"78"	"of some of the ruins yonder; of Homer--this was one of his many"
"79"	"birthplaces; of Cirmon of Athens; of Alcibiades, Lysander, Agesilaus"
"80"	"--they visited here; so did Alexander the Great; so did Hannibal and"
"81"	"Antiochus, Scipio, Lucullus and Sylla; Brutus, Cassius, Pompey, Cicero,"
"82"	"and Augustus; Antony was a judge in this place, and left his seat in the"
"83"	"open court, while the advocates were speaking, to run after Cleopatra,"
"84"	"who passed the door; from this city these two sailed on pleasure"
"85"	"excursions, in galleys with silver oars and perfumed sails, and with"
"86"	"companies of beautiful girls to serve them, and actors and musicians to"
"87"	"amuse them; in days that seem almost modern, so remote are they from the"
"88"	"early history of this city, Paul the Apostle preached the new religion"
"89"	"here, and so did John, and here it is supposed the former was pitted"
"90"	"against wild beasts, for in 1 Corinthians, xv. 32 he says:"
"91"	"     “If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,”"
"92"	"      &c.,"
"93"	"when many men still lived who had seen the Christ; here Mary Magdalen"
"94"	"died, and here the Virgin Mary ended her days with John, albeit Rome has"
"95"	"since judged it best to locate her grave elsewhere; six or seven hundred"
"96"	"years ago--almost yesterday, as it were--troops of mail-clad Crusaders"
"97"	"thronged the streets; and to come down to trifles, we speak of meandering"
"98"	"streams, and find a new interest in a common word when we discover that"
"99"	"the crooked river Meander, in yonder valley, gave it to our dictionary."
"100"	"It makes me feel as old as these dreary hills to look down upon these"
"101"	"moss-hung ruins, this historic desolation.  One may read the Scriptures"
"102"	"and believe, but he can not go and stand yonder in the ruined theatre and"
"103"	"in imagination people it again with the vanished multitudes who mobbed"
"104"	"Paul’s comrades there and shouted, with one voice, “Great is Diana of the"
"105"	"Ephesians!”  The idea of a shout in such a solitude as this almost makes"
"106"	"one shudder."
"107"	"It was a wonderful city, this Ephesus.  Go where you will about these"
"108"	"broad plains, you find the most exquisitely sculptured marble fragments"
"109"	"scattered thick among the dust and weeds; and protruding from the ground,"
"110"	"or lying prone upon it, are beautiful fluted columns of porphyry and all"
"111"	"precious marbles; and at every step you find elegantly carved capitals"
"112"	"and massive bases, and polished tablets engraved with Greek inscriptions."
"113"	"It is a world of precious relics, a wilderness of marred and mutilated"
"114"	"gems.  And yet what are these things to the wonders that lie buried here"
"115"	"under the ground?  At Constantinople, at Pisa, in the cities of Spain,"
"116"	"are great mosques and cathedrals, whose grandest columns came from the"
"117"	"temples and palaces of Ephesus, and yet one has only to scratch the"
"118"	"ground here to match them.  We shall never know what magnificence is,"
"119"	"until this imperial city is laid bare to the sun."
"120"	"The finest piece of sculpture we have yet seen and the one that impressed"
"121"	"us most, (for we do not know much about art and can not easily work up"
"122"	"ourselves into ecstasies over it,) is one that lies in this old theatre"
"123"	"of Ephesus which St. Paul’s riot has made so celebrated.  It is only the"
"124"	"headless body of a man, clad in a coat of mail, with a Medusa head upon"
"125"	"the breast-plate, but we feel persuaded that such dignity and such"
"126"	"majesty were never thrown into a form of stone before."
"127"	"What builders they were, these men of antiquity!  The massive arches of"
"128"	"some of these ruins rest upon piers that are fifteen feet square and"
"129"	"built entirely of solid blocks of marble, some of which are as large as a"
"130"	"Saratoga trunk, and some the size of a boarding-house sofa.  They are not"
"131"	"shells or shafts of stone filled inside with rubbish, but the whole pier"
"132"	"is a mass of solid masonry.  Vast arches, that may have been the gates of"
"133"	"the city, are built in the same way.  They have braved the storms and"
"134"	"sieges of three thousand years, and have been shaken by many an"
"135"	"earthquake, but still they stand.  When they dig alongside of them, they"
"136"	"find ranges of ponderous masonry that are as perfect in every detail as"
"137"	"they were the day those old Cyclopian giants finished them.  An English"
"138"	"Company is going to excavate Ephesus--and then!"
"139"	"And now am I reminded of--"
"140"	"                    THE LEGEND OF THE SEVEN SLEEPERS."
"141"	"In the Mount of Pion, yonder, is the Cave of the Seven Sleepers.  Once"
"142"	"upon a time, about fifteen hundred years ago, seven young men lived near"
"143"	"each other in Ephesus, who belonged to the despised sect of the"
"144"	"Christians.  It came to pass that the good King Maximilianus, (I am"
"145"	"telling this story for nice little boys and girls,) it came to pass, I"
"146"	"say, that the good King Maximilianus fell to persecuting the Christians,"
"147"	"and as time rolled on he made it very warm for them.  So the seven young"
"148"	"men said one to the other, let us get up and travel.  And they got up and"
"149"	"traveled.  They tarried not to bid their fathers and mothers good-bye, or"
"150"	"any friend they knew.  They only took certain moneys which their parents"
"151"	"had, and garments that belonged unto their friends, whereby they might"
"152"	"remember them when far away; and they took also the dog Ketmehr, which"
"153"	"was the property of their neighbor Malchus, because the beast did run his"
"154"	"head into a noose which one of the young men was carrying carelessly, and"
"155"	"they had not time to release him; and they took also certain chickens"
"156"	"that seemed lonely in the neighboring coops, and likewise some bottles of"
"157"	"curious liquors that stood near the grocer’s window; and then they"
"158"	"departed from the city.  By-and-by they came to a marvelous cave in the"
"159"	"Hill of Pion and entered into it and feasted, and presently they hurried"
"160"	"on again.  But they forgot the bottles of curious liquors, and left them"
"161"	"behind.  They traveled in many lands, and had many strange adventures."
"162"	"They were virtuous young men, and lost no opportunity that fell in their"
"163"	"way to make their livelihood.  Their motto was in these words, namely,"
"164"	"“Procrastination is the thief of time.”  And so, whenever they did come"
"165"	"upon a man who was alone, they said, Behold, this person hath the"
"166"	"wherewithal--let us go through him.  And they went through him.  At the"
"167"	"end of five years they had waxed tired of travel and adventure, and"
"168"	"longed to revisit their old home again and hear the voices and see the"
"169"	"faces that were dear unto their youth.  Therefore they went through such"
"170"	"parties as fell in their way where they sojourned at that time, and"
"171"	"journeyed back toward Ephesus again.  For the good King Maximilianus was"
"172"	"become converted unto the new faith, and the Christians rejoiced because"
"173"	"they were no longer persecuted.  One day as the sun went down, they came"
"174"	"to the cave in the Mount of Pion, and they said, each to his fellow, Let"
"175"	"us sleep here, and go and feast and make merry with our friends when the"
"176"	"morning cometh.  And each of the seven lifted up his voice and said, It"
"177"	"is a whiz.  So they went in, and lo, where they had put them, there lay"
"178"	"the bottles of strange liquors, and they judged that age had not impaired"
"179"	"their excellence.  Wherein the wanderers were right, and the heads of the"
"180"	"same were level.  So each of the young men drank six bottles, and behold"
"181"	"they felt very tired, then, and lay down and slept soundly."
"182"	"When they awoke, one of them, Johannes--surnamed Smithianus--said, We are"
"183"	"naked.  And it was so.  Their raiment was all gone, and the money which"
"184"	"they had gotten from a stranger whom they had proceeded through as they"
"185"	"approached the city, was lying upon the ground, corroded and rusted and"
"186"	"defaced.  Likewise the dog Ketmehr was gone, and nothing save the brass"
"187"	"that was upon his collar remained.  They wondered much at these things."
"188"	"But they took the money, and they wrapped about their bodies some leaves,"
"189"	"and came up to the top of the hill.  Then were they perplexed.  The"
"190"	"wonderful temple of Diana was gone; many grand edifices they had never"
"191"	"seen before stood in the city; men in strange garbs moved about the"
"192"	"streets, and every thing was changed."
"193"	"Johannes said, It hardly seems like Ephesus.  Yet here is the great"
"194"	"gymnasium; here is the mighty theatre, wherein I have seen seventy"
"195"	"thousand men assembled; here is the Agora; there is the font where the"
"196"	"sainted John the Baptist immersed the converts; yonder is the prison of"
"197"	"the good St. Paul, where we all did use to go to touch the ancient chains"
"198"	"that bound him and be cured of our distempers; I see the tomb of the"
"199"	"disciple Luke, and afar off is the church wherein repose the ashes of the"
"200"	"holy John, where the Christians of Ephesus go twice a year to gather the"
"201"	"dust from the tomb, which is able to make bodies whole again that are"
"202"	"corrupted by disease, and cleanse the soul from sin; but see how the"
"203"	"wharves encroach upon the sea, and what multitudes of ships are anchored"
"204"	"in the bay; see, also, how the city hath stretched abroad, far over the"
"205"	"valley behind Pion, and even unto the walls of Ayassalook; and lo, all"
"206"	"the hills are white with palaces and ribbed with colonnades of marble."
"207"	"How mighty is Ephesus become!"
"208"	"And wondering at what their eyes had seen, they went down into the city"
"209"	"and purchased garments and clothed themselves.  And when they would have"
"210"	"passed on, the merchant bit the coins which they had given him, with his"
"211"	"teeth, and turned them about and looked curiously upon them, and cast"
"212"	"them upon his counter, and listened if they rang; and then he said, These"
"213"	"be bogus.  And they said, Depart thou to Hades, and went their way.  When"
"214"	"they were come to their houses, they recognized them, albeit they seemed"
"215"	"old and mean; and they rejoiced, and were glad.  They ran to the doors,"
"216"	"and knocked, and strangers opened, and looked inquiringly upon them.  And"
"217"	"they said, with great excitement, while their hearts beat high, and the"
"218"	"color in their faces came and went, Where is my father?  Where is my"
"219"	"mother?  Where are Dionysius and Serapion, and Pericles, and Decius?  And"
"220"	"the strangers that opened said, We know not these.  The Seven said, How,"
"221"	"you know them not?  How long have ye dwelt here, and whither are they"
"222"	"gone that dwelt here before ye?  And the strangers said, Ye play upon us"
"223"	"with a jest, young men; we and our fathers have sojourned under these"
"224"	"roofs these six generations; the names ye utter rot upon the tombs, and"
"225"	"they that bore them have run their brief race, have laughed and sung,"
"226"	"have borne the sorrows and the weariness that were allotted them, and are"
"227"	"at rest; for nine-score years the summers have come and gone, and the"
"228"	"autumn leaves have fallen, since the roses faded out of their cheeks and"
"229"	"they laid them to sleep with the dead."
"230"	"Then the seven young men turned them away from their homes, and the"
"231"	"strangers shut the doors upon them.  The wanderers marveled greatly, and"
"232"	"looked into the faces of all they met, as hoping to find one that they"
"233"	"knew; but all were strange, and passed them by and spake no friendly"
"234"	"word.  They were sore distressed and sad.  Presently they spake unto a"
"235"	"citizen and said, Who is King in Ephesus?  And the citizen answered and"
"236"	"said, Whence come ye that ye know not that great Laertius reigns in"
"237"	"Ephesus?  They looked one at the other, greatly perplexed, and presently"
"238"	"asked again, Where, then, is the good King Maximilianus?  The citizen"
"239"	"moved him apart, as one who is afraid, and said, Verily these men be mad,"
"240"	"and dream dreams, else would they know that the King whereof they speak"
"241"	"is dead above two hundred years agone."
"242"	"Then the scales fell from the eyes of the Seven, and one said, Alas, that"
"243"	"we drank of the curious liquors.  They have made us weary, and in"
"244"	"dreamless sleep these two long centuries have we lain.  Our homes are"
"245"	"desolate, our friends are dead.  Behold, the jig is up--let us die.  And"
"246"	"that same day went they forth and laid them down and died.  And in that"
"247"	"self-same day, likewise, the Seven-up did cease in Ephesus, for that the"
"248"	"Seven that were up were down again, and departed and dead withal.  And"
"249"	"the names that be upon their tombs, even unto this time, are Johannes"
"250"	"Smithianus, Trumps, Gift, High, and Low, Jack, and The Game.  And with"
"251"	"the sleepers lie also the bottles wherein were once the curious liquors:"
"252"	"and upon them is writ, in ancient letters, such words as these--Dames of"
"253"	"heathen gods of olden time, perchance: Rumpunch, Jinsling, Egnog."
"254"	"Such is the story of the Seven Sleepers, (with slight variations,) and I"
"255"	"know it is true, because I have seen the cave myself."
"256"	"Really, so firm a faith had the ancients this legend, that as late as"
"257"	"eight or nine hundred years ago, learned travelers held it in"
"258"	"superstitious fear.  Two of them record that they ventured into it, but"
"259"	"ran quickly out again, not daring to tarry lest they should fall asleep"
"260"	"and outlive their great grand-children a century or so.  Even at this day"
"261"	"the ignorant denizens of the neighboring country prefer not to sleep in"
"262"	"it."
