"1"	"CHAPTER XXXII."
"2"	"Home, again!  For the first time, in many weeks, the ship’s entire family"
"3"	"met and shook hands on the quarter-deck.  They had gathered from many"
"4"	"points of the compass and from many lands, but not one was missing; there"
"5"	"was no tale of sickness or death among the flock to dampen the pleasure"
"6"	"of the reunion.  Once more there was a full audience on deck to listen to"
"7"	"the sailors’ chorus as they got the anchor up, and to wave an adieu to"
"8"	"the land as we sped away from Naples.  The seats were full at dinner"
"9"	"again, the domino parties were complete, and the life and bustle on the"
"10"	"upper deck in the fine moonlight at night was like old times--old times"
"11"	"that had been gone weeks only, but yet they were weeks so crowded with"
"12"	"incident, adventure and excitement, that they seemed almost like years."
"13"	"There was no lack of cheerfulness on board the Quaker City.  For once,"
"14"	"her title was a misnomer."
"15"	"At seven in the evening, with the western horizon all golden from the"
"16"	"sunken sun, and specked with distant ships, the full moon sailing high"
"17"	"over head, the dark blue of the sea under foot, and a strange sort of"
"18"	"twilight affected by all these different lights and colors around us and"
"19"	"about us, we sighted superb Stromboli.  With what majesty the monarch"
"20"	"held his lonely state above the level sea!  Distance clothed him in a"
"21"	"purple gloom, and added a veil of shimmering mist that so softened his"
"22"	"rugged features that we seemed to see him through a web of silver gauze."
"23"	"His torch was out; his fires were smoldering; a tall column of smoke that"
"24"	"rose up and lost itself in the growing moonlight was all the sign he gave"
"25"	"that he was a living Autocrat of the Sea and not the spectre of a dead"
"26"	"one."
"27"	"At two in the morning we swept through the Straits of Messina, and so"
"28"	"bright was the moonlight that Italy on the one hand and Sicily on the"
"29"	"other seemed almost as distinctly visible as though we looked at them"
"30"	"from the middle of a street we were traversing.  The city of Messina,"
"31"	"milk-white, and starred and spangled all over with gaslights, was a fairy"
"32"	"spectacle.  A great party of us were on deck smoking and making a noise,"
"33"	"and waiting to see famous Scylla and Charybdis.  And presently the Oracle"
"34"	"stepped out with his eternal spy-glass and squared himself on the deck"
"35"	"like another Colossus of Rhodes.  It was a surprise to see him abroad at"
"36"	"such an hour.  Nobody supposed he cared anything about an old fable like"
"37"	"that of Scylla and Charybdis.  One of the boys said:"
"38"	"“Hello, doctor, what are you doing up here at this time of night?--What"
"39"	"do you want to see this place for?”"
"40"	"“What do I want to see this place for?  Young man, little do you know me,"
"41"	"or you wouldn’t ask such a question.  I wish to see all the places that’s"
"42"	"mentioned in the Bible.”"
"43"	"“Stuff--this place isn’t mentioned in the Bible.”"
"44"	"“It ain’t mentioned in the Bible!--this place ain’t--well now, what place"
"45"	"is this, since you know so much about it?”"
"46"	"“Why it’s Scylla and Charybdis.”"
"47"	"“Scylla and Cha--confound it, I thought it was Sodom and Gomorrah!”"
"48"	"And he closed up his glass and went below.  The above is the ship story."
"49"	"Its plausibility is marred a little by the fact that the Oracle was not a"
"50"	"biblical student, and did not spend much of his time instructing himself"
"51"	"about Scriptural localities.--They say the Oracle complains, in this hot"
"52"	"weather, lately, that the only beverage in the ship that is passable, is"
"53"	"the butter.  He did not mean butter, of course, but inasmuch as that"
"54"	"article remains in a melted state now since we are out of ice, it is fair"
"55"	"to give him the credit of getting one long word in the right place,"
"56"	"anyhow, for once in his life.  He said, in Rome, that the Pope was a"
"57"	"noble-looking old man, but he never did think much of his Iliad."
"58"	"We spent one pleasant day skirting along the Isles of Greece.  They are"
"59"	"very mountainous.  Their prevailing tints are gray and brown, approaching"
"60"	"to red.  Little white villages surrounded by trees, nestle in the valleys"
"61"	"or roost upon the lofty perpendicular sea-walls."
"62"	"We had one fine sunset--a rich carmine flush that suffused the western"
"63"	"sky and cast a ruddy glow far over the sea.--Fine sunsets seem to be"
"64"	"rare in this part of the world--or at least, striking ones.  They are"
"65"	"soft, sensuous, lovely--they are exquisite refined, effeminate, but we"
"66"	"have seen no sunsets here yet like the gorgeous conflagrations that flame"
"67"	"in the track of the sinking sun in our high northern latitudes."
"68"	"But what were sunsets to us, with the wild excitement upon us of"
"69"	"approaching the most renowned of cities!  What cared we for outward"
"70"	"visions, when Agamemnon, Achilles, and a thousand other heroes of the"
"71"	"great Past were marching in ghostly procession through our fancies?  What"
"72"	"were sunsets to us, who were about to live and breathe and walk in actual"
"73"	"Athens; yea, and go far down into the dead centuries and bid in person"
"74"	"for the slaves, Diogenes and Plato, in the public market-place, or gossip"
"75"	"with the neighbors about the siege of Troy or the splendid deeds of"
"76"	"Marathon?  We scorned to consider sunsets."
"77"	"We arrived, and entered the ancient harbor of the Piraeus at last.  We"
"78"	"dropped anchor within half a mile of the village.  Away off, across the"
"79"	"undulating Plain of Attica, could be seen a little square-topped hill"
"80"	"with a something on it, which our glasses soon discovered to be the"
"81"	"ruined edifices of the citadel of the Athenians, and most prominent among"
"82"	"them loomed the venerable Parthenon.  So exquisitely clear and pure is"
"83"	"this wonderful atmosphere that every column of the noble structure was"
"84"	"discernible through the telescope, and even the smaller ruins about it"
"85"	"assumed some semblance of shape.  This at a distance of five or six"
"86"	"miles.  In the valley, near the Acropolis, (the square-topped hill before"
"87"	"spoken of,) Athens itself could be vaguely made out with an ordinary"
"88"	"lorgnette.  Every body was anxious to get ashore and visit these classic"
"89"	"localities as quickly as possible.  No land we had yet seen had aroused"
"90"	"such universal interest among the passengers."
"91"	"But bad news came.  The commandant of the Piraeus came in his boat, and"
"92"	"said we must either depart or else get outside the harbor and remain"
"93"	"imprisoned in our ship, under rigid quarantine, for eleven days!  So we"
"94"	"took up the anchor and moved outside, to lie a dozen hours or so, taking"
"95"	"in supplies, and then sail for Constantinople.  It was the bitterest"
"96"	"disappointment we had yet experienced.  To lie a whole day in sight of"
"97"	"the Acropolis, and yet be obliged to go away without visiting Athens!"
"98"	"Disappointment was hardly a strong enough word to describe the"
"99"	"circumstances."
"100"	"All hands were on deck, all the afternoon, with books and maps and"
"101"	"glasses, trying to determine which “narrow rocky ridge” was the"
"102"	"Areopagus, which sloping hill the Pnyx, which elevation the Museum Hill,"
"103"	"and so on.  And we got things confused.  Discussion became heated, and"
"104"	"party spirit ran high.  Church members were gazing with emotion upon a"
"105"	"hill which they said was the one St. Paul preached from, and another"
"106"	"faction claimed that that hill was Hymettus, and another that it was"
"107"	"Pentelicon!  After all the trouble, we could be certain of only one"
"108"	"thing--the square-topped hill was the Acropolis, and the grand ruin that"
"109"	"crowned it was the Parthenon, whose picture we knew in infancy in the"
"110"	"school books."
"111"	"We inquired of every body who came near the ship, whether there were"
"112"	"guards in the Piraeus, whether they were strict, what the chances were of"
"113"	"capture should any of us slip ashore, and in case any of us made the"
"114"	"venture and were caught, what would be probably done to us?  The answers"
"115"	"were discouraging: There was a strong guard or police force; the Piraeus"
"116"	"was a small town, and any stranger seen in it would surely attract"
"117"	"attention--capture would be certain.  The commandant said the punishment"
"118"	"would be “heavy;” when asked “how heavy?” he said it would be “very"
"119"	"severe”--that was all we could get out of him."
"120"	"At eleven o’clock at night, when most of the ship’s company were abed,"
"121"	"four of us stole softly ashore in a small boat, a clouded moon favoring"
"122"	"the enterprise, and started two and two, and far apart, over a low hill,"
"123"	"intending to go clear around the Piraeus, out of the range of its police."
"124"	"Picking our way so stealthily over that rocky, nettle-grown eminence,"
"125"	"made me feel a good deal as if I were on my way somewhere to steal"
"126"	"something.  My immediate comrade and I talked in an undertone about"
"127"	"quarantine laws and their penalties, but we found nothing cheering in the"
"128"	"subject.  I was posted.  Only a few days before, I was talking with our"
"129"	"captain, and he mentioned the case of a man who swam ashore from a"
"130"	"quarantined ship somewhere, and got imprisoned six months for it; and"
"131"	"when he was in Genoa a few years ago, a captain of a quarantined ship"
"132"	"went in his boat to a departing ship, which was already outside of the"
"133"	"harbor, and put a letter on board to be taken to his family, and the"
"134"	"authorities imprisoned him three months for it, and then conducted him"
"135"	"and his ship fairly to sea, and warned him never to show himself in that"
"136"	"port again while he lived.  This kind of conversation did no good,"
"137"	"further than to give a sort of dismal interest to our quarantine-breaking"
"138"	"expedition, and so we dropped it.  We made the entire circuit of the town"
"139"	"without seeing any body but one man, who stared at us curiously, but said"
"140"	"nothing, and a dozen persons asleep on the ground before their doors,"
"141"	"whom we walked among and never woke--but we woke up dogs enough, in all"
"142"	"conscience--we always had one or two barking at our heels, and several"
"143"	"times we had as many as ten and twelve at once.  They made such a"
"144"	"preposterous din that persons aboard our ship said they could tell how we"
"145"	"were progressing for a long time, and where we were, by the barking of"
"146"	"the dogs.  The clouded moon still favored us.  When we had made the whole"
"147"	"circuit, and were passing among the houses on the further side of the"
"148"	"town, the moon came out splendidly, but we no longer feared the light."
"149"	"As we approached a well, near a house, to get a drink, the owner merely"
"150"	"glanced at us and went within.  He left the quiet, slumbering town at our"
"151"	"mercy.  I record it here proudly, that we didn’t do any thing to it."
"152"	"Seeing no road, we took a tall hill to the left of the distant Acropolis"
"153"	"for a mark, and steered straight for it over all obstructions, and over a"
"154"	"little rougher piece of country than exists any where else outside of the"
"155"	"State of Nevada, perhaps.  Part of the way it was covered with small,"
"156"	"loose stones--we trod on six at a time, and they all rolled.  Another"
"157"	"part of it was dry, loose, newly-ploughed ground.  Still another part of"
"158"	"it was a long stretch of low grape-vines, which were tanglesome and"
"159"	"troublesome, and which we took to be brambles.  The Attic Plain, barring"
"160"	"the grape-vines, was a barren, desolate, unpoetical waste--I wonder what"
"161"	"it was in Greece’s Age of Glory, five hundred years before Christ?"
"162"	"In the neighborhood of one o’clock in the morning, when we were heated"
"163"	"with fast walking and parched with thirst, Denny exclaimed, “Why, these"
"164"	"weeds are grape-vines!”  and in five minutes we had a score of bunches of"
"165"	"large, white, delicious grapes, and were reaching down for more when a"
"166"	"dark shape rose mysteriously up out of the shadows beside us and said"
"167"	"“Ho!”  And so we left."
"168"	"In ten minutes more we struck into a beautiful road, and unlike some"
"169"	"others we had stumbled upon at intervals, it led in the right direction."
"170"	"We followed it.  It was broad, and smooth, and white--handsome and in"
"171"	"perfect repair, and shaded on both sides for a mile or so with single"
"172"	"ranks of trees, and also with luxuriant vineyards.  Twice we entered and"
"173"	"stole grapes, and the second time somebody shouted at us from some"
"174"	"invisible place.  Whereupon we left again.  We speculated in grapes no"
"175"	"more on that side of Athens."
"176"	"Shortly we came upon an ancient stone aqueduct, built upon arches, and"
"177"	"from that time forth we had ruins all about us--we were approaching our"
"178"	"journey’s end.  We could not see the Acropolis now or the high hill,"
"179"	"either, and I wanted to follow the road till we were abreast of them, but"
"180"	"the others overruled me, and we toiled laboriously up the stony hill"
"181"	"immediately in our front--and from its summit saw another--climbed it and"
"182"	"saw another!  It was an hour of exhausting work.  Soon we came upon a row"
"183"	"of open graves, cut in the solid rock--(for a while one of them served"
"184"	"Socrates for a prison)--we passed around the shoulder of the hill, and"
"185"	"the citadel, in all its ruined magnificence, burst upon us!  We hurried"
"186"	"across the ravine and up a winding road, and stood on the old Acropolis,"
"187"	"with the prodigious walls of the citadel towering above our heads.  We"
"188"	"did not stop to inspect their massive blocks of marble, or measure their"
"189"	"height, or guess at their extraordinary thickness, but passed at once"
"190"	"through a great arched passage like a railway tunnel, and went straight"
"191"	"to the gate that leads to the ancient temples.  It was locked!  So, after"
"192"	"all, it seemed that we were not to see the great Parthenon face to face."
"193"	"We sat down and held a council of war.  Result: the gate was only a"
"194"	"flimsy structure of wood--we would break it down.  It seemed like"
"195"	"desecration, but then we had traveled far, and our necessities were"
"196"	"urgent.  We could not hunt up guides and keepers--we must be on the ship"
"197"	"before daylight.  So we argued.  This was all very fine, but when we came"
"198"	"to break the gate, we could not do it.  We moved around an angle of the"
"199"	"wall and found a low bastion--eight feet high without--ten or twelve"
"200"	"within.  Denny prepared to scale it, and we got ready to follow.  By dint"
"201"	"of hard scrambling he finally straddled the top, but some loose stones"
"202"	"crumbled away and fell with a crash into the court within.  There was"
"203"	"instantly a banging of doors and a shout.  Denny dropped from the wall in"
"204"	"a twinkling, and we retreated in disorder to the gate.  Xerxes took that"
"205"	"mighty citadel four hundred and eighty years before Christ, when his five"
"206"	"millions of soldiers and camp-followers followed him to Greece, and if we"
"207"	"four Americans could have remained unmolested five minutes longer, we"
"208"	"would have taken it too."
"209"	"The garrison had turned out--four Greeks.  We clamored at the gate, and"
"210"	"they admitted us.  [Bribery and corruption.]"
"211"	"We crossed a large court, entered a great door, and stood upon a pavement"
"212"	"of purest white marble, deeply worn by footprints.  Before us, in the"
"213"	"flooding moonlight, rose the noblest ruins we had ever looked upon--the"
"214"	"Propylae; a small Temple of Minerva; the Temple of Hercules, and the"
"215"	"grand Parthenon.  [We got these names from the Greek guide, who didn’t"
"216"	"seem to know more than seven men ought to know.] These edifices were all"
"217"	"built of the whitest Pentelic marble, but have a pinkish stain upon them"
"218"	"now.  Where any part is broken, however, the fracture looks like fine"
"219"	"loaf sugar.  Six caryatides, or marble women, clad in flowing robes,"
"220"	"support the portico of the Temple of Hercules, but the porticos and"
"221"	"colonnades of the other structures are formed of massive Doric and Ionic"
"222"	"pillars, whose flutings and capitals are still measurably perfect,"
"223"	"notwithstanding the centuries that have gone over them and the sieges"
"224"	"they have suffered.  The Parthenon, originally, was two hundred and"
"225"	"twenty-six feet long, one hundred wide, and seventy high, and had two"
"226"	"rows of great columns, eight in each, at either end, and single rows of"
"227"	"seventeen each down the sides, and was one of the most graceful and"
"228"	"beautiful edifices ever erected."
"229"	"Most of the Parthenon’s imposing columns are still standing, but the roof"
"230"	"is gone.  It was a perfect building two hundred and fifty years ago, when"
"231"	"a shell dropped into the Venetian magazine stored here, and the explosion"
"232"	"which followed wrecked and unroofed it.  I remember but little about the"
"233"	"Parthenon, and I have put in one or two facts and figures for the use of"
"234"	"other people with short memories.  Got them from the guide-book."
"235"	"As we wandered thoughtfully down the marble-paved length of this stately"
"236"	"temple, the scene about us was strangely impressive.  Here and there, in"
"237"	"lavish profusion, were gleaming white statues of men and women, propped"
"238"	"against blocks of marble, some of them armless, some without legs, others"
"239"	"headless--but all looking mournful in the moonlight, and startlingly"
"240"	"human!  They rose up and confronted the midnight intruder on every side"
"241"	"--they stared at him with stony eyes from unlooked-for nooks and recesses;"
"242"	"they peered at him over fragmentary heaps far down the desolate"
"243"	"corridors; they barred his way in the midst of the broad forum, and"
"244"	"solemnly pointed with handless arms the way from the sacred fane; and"
"245"	"through the roofless temple the moon looked down, and banded the floor"
"246"	"and darkened the scattered fragments and broken statues with the slanting"
"247"	"shadows of the columns."
"248"	"What a world of ruined sculpture was about us!  Set up in rows--stacked"
"249"	"up in piles--scattered broadcast over the wide area of the Acropolis"
"250"	"--were hundreds of crippled statues of all sizes and of the most exquisite"
"251"	"workmanship; and vast fragments of marble that once belonged to the"
"252"	"entablatures, covered with bas-reliefs representing battles and sieges,"
"253"	"ships of war with three and four tiers of oars, pageants and processions"
"254"	"--every thing one could think of.  History says that the temples of the"
"255"	"Acropolis were filled with the noblest works of Praxiteles and Phidias,"
"256"	"and of many a great master in sculpture besides--and surely these elegant"
"257"	"fragments attest it."
"258"	"We walked out into the grass-grown, fragment-strewn court beyond the"
"259"	"Parthenon.  It startled us, every now and then, to see a stony white face"
"260"	"stare suddenly up at us out of the grass with its dead eyes.  The place"
"261"	"seemed alive with ghosts.  I half expected to see the Athenian heroes of"
"262"	"twenty centuries ago glide out of the shadows and steal into the old"
"263"	"temple they knew so well and regarded with such boundless pride."
"264"	"The full moon was riding high in the cloudless heavens, now.  We"
"265"	"sauntered carelessly and unthinkingly to the edge of the lofty"
"266"	"battlements of the citadel, and looked down--a vision!  And such a"
"267"	"vision!  Athens by moonlight!  The prophet that thought the splendors of"
"268"	"the New Jerusalem were revealed to him, surely saw this instead!  It lay"
"269"	"in the level plain right under our feet--all spread abroad like a"
"270"	"picture--and we looked down upon it as we might have looked from a"
"271"	"balloon.  We saw no semblance of a street, but every house, every window,"
"272"	"every clinging vine, every projection was as distinct and sharply marked"
"273"	"as if the time were noon-day; and yet there was no glare, no glitter,"
"274"	"nothing harsh or repulsive--the noiseless city was flooded with the"
"275"	"mellowest light that ever streamed from the moon, and seemed like some"
"276"	"living creature wrapped in peaceful slumber.  On its further side was a"
"277"	"little temple, whose delicate pillars and ornate front glowed with a rich"
"278"	"lustre that chained the eye like a spell; and nearer by, the palace of"
"279"	"the king reared its creamy walls out of the midst of a great garden of"
"280"	"shrubbery that was flecked all over with a random shower of amber lights"
"281"	"--a spray of golden sparks that lost their brightness in the glory of the"
"282"	"moon, and glinted softly upon the sea of dark foliage like the pallid"
"283"	"stars of the milky-way.  Overhead the stately columns, majestic still in"
"284"	"their ruin--under foot the dreaming city--in the distance the silver sea"
"285"	"--not on the broad earth is there an other picture half so beautiful!"
"286"	"As we turned and moved again through the temple, I wished that the"
"287"	"illustrious men who had sat in it in the remote ages could visit it again"
"288"	"and reveal themselves to our curious eyes--Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes,"
"289"	"Socrates, Phocion, Pythagoras, Euclid, Pindar, Xenophon, Herodotus,"
"290"	"Praxiteles and Phidias, Zeuxis the painter.  What a constellation of"
"291"	"celebrated names!  But more than all, I wished that old Diogenes, groping"
"292"	"so patiently with his lantern, searching so zealously for one solitary"
"293"	"honest man in all the world, might meander along and stumble on our"
"294"	"party.  I ought not to say it, may be, but still I suppose he would have"
"295"	"put out his light."
"296"	"We left the Parthenon to keep its watch over old Athens, as it had kept"
"297"	"it for twenty-three hundred years, and went and stood outside the walls"
"298"	"of the citadel.  In the distance was the ancient, but still almost"
"299"	"perfect Temple of Theseus, and close by, looking to the west, was the"
"300"	"Bema, from whence Demosthenes thundered his philippics and fired the"
"301"	"wavering patriotism of his countrymen.  To the right was Mars Hill, where"
"302"	"the Areopagus sat in ancient times and where St. Paul defined his"
"303"	"position, and below was the market-place where he “disputed daily” with"
"304"	"the gossip-loving Athenians.  We climbed the stone steps St. Paul"
"305"	"ascended, and stood in the square-cut place he stood in, and tried to"
"306"	"recollect the Bible account of the matter--but for certain reasons, I"
"307"	"could not recall the words.  I have found them since:"
"308"	"     “Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in"
"309"	"     him, when he saw the city wholly given up to idolatry.  Therefore"
"310"	"     disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout"
"311"	"     persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him."
"312"	"                         * * * * * * * * *"
"313"	"     “And they took him and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we"
"314"	"     know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is?"
"315"	"                         * * * * * * * * *"
"316"	"     “Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars hill, and said, Ye men of"
"317"	"     Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious; For"
"318"	"     as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this"
"319"	"     inscription: To THE UNKNOWN GOD.  Whom, therefore, ye ignorantly"
"320"	"     worship, him declare I unto you.”--Acts, ch. xvii.”"
"321"	"It occurred to us, after a while, that if we wanted to get home before"
"322"	"daylight betrayed us, we had better be moving.  So we hurried away.  When"
"323"	"far on our road, we had a parting view of the Parthenon, with the"
"324"	"moonlight streaming through its open colonnades and touching its capitals"
"325"	"with silver.  As it looked then, solemn, grand, and beautiful it will"
"326"	"always remain in our memories."
"327"	"As we marched along, we began to get over our fears, and ceased to care"
"328"	"much about quarantine scouts or any body else.  We grew bold and"
"329"	"reckless; and once, in a sudden burst of courage, I even threw a stone at"
"330"	"a dog.  It was a pleasant reflection, though, that I did not hit him,"
"331"	"because his master might just possibly have been a policeman.  Inspired"
"332"	"by this happy failure, my valor became utterly uncontrollable, and at"
"333"	"intervals I absolutely whistled, though on a moderate key.  But boldness"
"334"	"breeds boldness, and shortly I plunged into a Vineyard, in the full light"
"335"	"of the moon, and captured a gallon of superb grapes, not even minding the"
"336"	"presence of a peasant who rode by on a mule.  Denny and Birch followed my"
"337"	"example."
"338"	"Now I had grapes enough for a dozen, but then Jackson was all swollen up"
"339"	"with courage, too, and he was obliged to enter a vineyard presently.  The"
"340"	"first bunch he seized brought trouble.  A frowsy, bearded brigand sprang"
"341"	"into the road with a shout, and flourished a musket in the light of the"
"342"	"moon!  We sidled toward the Piraeus--not running you understand, but only"
"343"	"advancing with celerity.  The brigand shouted again, but still we"
"344"	"advanced.  It was getting late, and we had no time to fool away on every"
"345"	"ass that wanted to drivel Greek platitudes to us.  We would just as soon"
"346"	"have talked with him as not if we had not been in a hurry.  Presently"
"347"	"Denny said, “Those fellows are following us!”"
"348"	"We turned, and, sure enough, there they were--three fantastic pirates"
"349"	"armed with guns.  We slackened our pace to let them come up, and in the"
"350"	"meantime I got out my cargo of grapes and dropped them firmly but"
"351"	"reluctantly into the shadows by the wayside.  But I was not afraid.  I"
"352"	"only felt that it was not right to steal grapes.  And all the more so"
"353"	"when the owner was around--and not only around, but with his friends"
"354"	"around also.  The villains came up and searched a bundle Dr. Birch had in"
"355"	"his hand, and scowled upon him when they found it had nothing in it but"
"356"	"some holy rocks from Mars Hill, and these were not contraband.  They"
"357"	"evidently suspected him of playing some wretched fraud upon them, and"
"358"	"seemed half inclined to scalp the party.  But finally they dismissed us"
"359"	"with a warning, couched in excellent Greek, I suppose, and dropped"
"360"	"tranquilly in our wake.  When they had gone three hundred yards they"
"361"	"stopped, and we went on rejoiced.  But behold, another armed rascal came"
"362"	"out of the shadows and took their place, and followed us two hundred"
"363"	"yards.  Then he delivered us over to another miscreant, who emerged from"
"364"	"some mysterious place, and he in turn to another!  For a mile and a half"
"365"	"our rear was guarded all the while by armed men.  I never traveled in so"
"366"	"much state before in all my life."
"367"	"It was a good while after that before we ventured to steal any more"
"368"	"grapes, and when we did we stirred up another troublesome brigand, and"
"369"	"then we ceased all further speculation in that line.  I suppose that"
"370"	"fellow that rode by on the mule posted all the sentinels, from Athens to"
"371"	"the Piraeus, about us."
"372"	"Every field on that long route was watched by an armed sentinel, some of"
"373"	"whom had fallen asleep, no doubt, but were on hand, nevertheless.  This"
"374"	"shows what sort of a country modern Attica is--a community of"
"375"	"questionable characters.  These men were not there to guard their"
"376"	"possessions against strangers, but against each other; for strangers"
"377"	"seldom visit Athens and the Piraeus, and when they do, they go in"
"378"	"daylight, and can buy all the grapes they want for a trifle.  The modern"
"379"	"inhabitants are confiscators and falsifiers of high repute, if gossip"
"380"	"speaks truly concerning them, and I freely believe it does."
"381"	"Just as the earliest tinges of the dawn flushed the eastern sky and"
"382"	"turned the pillared Parthenon to a broken harp hung in the pearly"
"383"	"horizon, we closed our thirteenth mile of weary, round-about marching,"
"384"	"and emerged upon the sea-shore abreast the ships, with our usual escort"
"385"	"of fifteen hundred Piraean dogs howling at our heels.  We hailed a boat"
"386"	"that was two or three hundred yards from shore, and discovered"
"387"	"in a moment that it was a police-boat on the lookout for any"
"388"	"quarantine-breakers that might chance to be abroad.  So we dodged--we"
"389"	"were used to that by this time--and when the scouts reached the spot we"
"390"	"had so lately occupied, we were absent.  They cruised along the shore,"
"391"	"but in the wrong direction, and shortly our own boat issued from the"
"392"	"gloom and took us aboard.  They had heard our signal on the ship.  We"
"393"	"rowed noiselessly away, and before the police-boat came in sight again,"
"394"	"we were safe at home once more."
"395"	"Four more of our passengers were anxious to visit Athens, and started"
"396"	"half an hour after we returned; but they had not been ashore five minutes"
"397"	"till the police discovered and chased them so hotly that they barely"
"398"	"escaped to their boat again, and that was all.  They pursued the"
"399"	"enterprise no further."
"400"	"We set sail for Constantinople to-day, but some of us little care for"
"401"	"that.  We have seen all there was to see in the old city that had its"
"402"	"birth sixteen hundred years before Christ was born, and was an old town"
"403"	"before the foundations of Troy were laid--and saw it in its most"
"404"	"attractive aspect.  Wherefore, why should we worry?"
"405"	"Two other passengers ran the blockade successfully last night.  So we"
"406"	"learned this morning.  They slipped away so quietly that they were not"
"407"	"missed from the ship for several hours.  They had the hardihood to march"
"408"	"into the Piraeus in the early dusk and hire a carriage.  They ran some"
"409"	"danger of adding two or three months’ imprisonment to the other novelties"
"410"	"of their Holy Land Pleasure Excursion.  I admire “cheek.”--[Quotation"
"411"	"from the Pilgrims.]--But they went and came safely, and never walked a"
"412"	"step."
